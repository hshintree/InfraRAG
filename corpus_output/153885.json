To any such separate general meeting, all of the provisions of these\nArticles relating to general meetings shall mutatis mutandis apply, but so that the necessary quorum shall be any one or more persons holding or representing by\nproxy not less than one third of the issued Shares of the class and that any holder of Shares of the relevant class present in person or by proxy may demand a poll.\nTreatment of classes\n27.\nFor the purpose of a separate class meeting, the Directors may treat two or more of all classes of Shares as forming one class if they consider that such class of\nShares would be affected in the same way by the proposals under consideration.\nEffect of Share issue on class rights\n28.\nThe rights conferred upon the holders of any Shares shall not, unless otherwise expressly provided in the rights attaching to such Shares, be deemed to be altered\nby the creation or issue of further Shares ranking pari passu therewith.\nNON-RECOGNITION OF TRUSTS\n29.\nExcept as required by the Law or these Articles, or under an order of a court of competent jurisdiction, the Company shall not be bound by or compelled to\nrecognise in any way, even when notice thereof is given to it, any equitable, contingent, future or partial interest in any Share, or any other rights in respect of any\nShare other than an absolute right to the entirety thereof in the registered holder.\n9\nLIEN\nLien generally\n30.\nThe Company shall have a first and paramount lien on every Share (not being a fully paid Share) for all moneys (whether presently payable or not) called or\npayable at a date fixed by or in accordance with the terms of issue of such Share in respect of that Share, and the Company shall also have a first and paramount\nlien on every Share (other than a fully paid up Share) standing registered in the name of a Member, whether singly or jointly with any other person for all debts and\nliabilities of a Member or his estate to the Company, whether the same shall have been incurred before or after notice to the Company of any interest of any person\nother than such Member, and whether the time for the payment or discharge of the same shall have actually arrived or not, and notwithstanding that the same are\njoint debts or liabilities of such Member or his estate and any other person, whether a Member or not. The Directors may at any time, either generally or in any\nparticular case, waive any lien that has arisen or declare any Share to be wholly or in part exempt from the provisions of this Article. The Company's lien, if any,\non a Share shall extTermination to all dividTerminations payable thereon.\nEnforcement\n31.\nThe Company may sell, in such manner as the Directors think fit, any Share on which the Company has a lien, provided a sum in respect of which the lien exists is\npresently payable, and is not paid within fourteen days after a notice in writing has been given to the registered holder for the time being of the Share, demanding\npayment of the sum presently payable and giving notice of the intention to sell in default of such payment.\nCompletion of sale\n32.\nFor giving effect to any such sale, the Directors may authorise any person to Assignment the Share sold to the purchaser thereof.

A call may be revoked or postponed by the Directors wholly or in part as the Directors may\ndetermine. A call shall be deemed to have been made at the time when the resolution of the Directors authorising the call was passed.\n10\nPayment\n35.\nPayment of a call may be made by instalments on the direction of the\nDirectors.\n36.\nIf a sum called in respect of a Share is not paid before or on the day appointed for payment thereof, the person from whom the sum is due shall pay interest on the\nsum from the day payment is due to the time of the actual payment at such rate as the Directors may determine, but the Directors may waive payment of such\ninterest wholly or in part.\n37.\nAny sum payable in respect of a Share on issue or allotment or at any fixed date, whether in respect of the par value of the Share or premium or otherwise, shall be\ndeemed to be a call and if it is not paid all the relevant provisions as to payment of interest, forfeiture or otherwise of these Articles shall apply as if such sum had\nbecome due and payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified.\n38.\nThe Directors may issue Shares with different terms as to the amount and times of payment of\ncalls.\nLiability of joint holders\n39.\nThe joint holders of a Share shall be jointly and severally liable to pay calls in respect\nthereof.\nInterest\n40.\nThe Directors may, if they think fit, receive from any Member willing to advance the same, all or any part of the moneys uncalled and unpaid upon any Shares held\nby him; and may (until the amount would otherwise become payable) pay interest at such rate (not exceeding six per cent without the sanction of the Company in\ngeneral meeting) as may be agreed upon between the Member paying the sum in advance and the Directors.\nFORFEITURE OF SHARES\nNotice\n41.\nIf a Member fails to pay any call or instalment of a call by the date it becomes due and payable, the Directors may, at any time thereafter while such call or\ninstalment remains unpaid, give notice to the Member requiring payment of the unpaid portion of the call or instalment, together with any accrued interest and\nexpenses incurred by the Company by reason of such non-payment.\n11\n42.\nThe notice shall specify where and by what date (not being less than the Termination of 14 days’ from the date of the notice) payment is to be made and shall state\nthat if it is not complied with the Shares in respect of which the call was made will be liable to be forfeited. The Directors may accept the surrTerminationer of any Share\nliable to be forfeited hereunder and, in such case, references to these Articles to forfeiture shall include surrTerminationer.\nForfeiture for non-compliance\n43.\nIf such notice is not complied with, any Share in respect of which the notice was given may thereafter, before the payment of all calls or instalments and interest\ndue in respect thereof has been made, be forfeited by a resolution of the Directors. Such forfeiture shall include all dividTerminations declared, other distributions or other\nmonies payable in respect of the forfeited Shares and not paid before the forfeiture.\nForfeited Shares\n44.\nA forfeited Share may be sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed of upon such terms and in such manner as the Directors shall think fit, and at any time before a\nsale, re-allotment or disposition, the forfeiture may be cancelled on such terms as the Directors think fit.\nContinued liability for forfeited Member\n45.\nA person whose Shares have been forfeited shall cease to be a Member in respect of the forfeited Shares, but shall remain liable to pay to the Company all moneys\nwhich at the date of forfeiture were presently payable by him in respect of the Shares together with interest at such rate as the Directors may determine from the\ndate of forfeiture until payment, but his liability shall cease if and when the Company receives payment in full of all amounts due in respect of the Shares. The\nCompany may enforce payment without being under any obligation to make any allowance for the value of the Shares forfeited.\nEvidence of forfeiture\n46.\nAn affidavit in writing by a Director or Secretary of the Company that a Share has been duly forfeited on a specified date, shall be conclusive evidence of the facts\nstated in it as against all persons claiming to be entitled to the Share. The Company may receive the consideration, if any, given for the Share on any sale, re-\nallotment or disposition thereof and may authorise some person to execute a Assignment of the Share in favour of the person to whom the Share is sold, re-allotted or\notherwise disposed of, and he shall thereupon be registered as the holder of the Share, and shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money (if\nany) nor shall his title to the Share be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings in reference to the forfeiture, sale, re-allotment or disposition of\nthe Share.\n12\n47.\nThe provisions of these Articles as to forfeiture shall apply in the case of non-payment of any sum which, by the terms of issue of a Share, becomes payable at a\nfixed time, whether on account of the par value of the Share, or by way of premium or otherwise, as if the same had been made payable by virtue of a call duly\nmade and notified to the Member.\nINCREASE OF CAPITAL\n48.\nThe Company may from time to time by Ordinary Resolution increase its share capital by such sum, to be divided into new Shares of such par value, and with such\nrights, priorities and privileges attached thereto as the resolution shall prescribe.\n49.\nSubject to any directions given by the Company in a general meeting, all new Shares shall be at the disposal of the Directors in accordance with these\nArticles.\n50.\nThe new Shares shall be subject to the same provisions of these Articles with reference to the payment of calls, lien, forfeiture, Assignment, transmission and\notherwise, as the Shares in the original share capital.\nALTERATION OF CAPITAL\n51.\nThe Company may from time to time by Ordinary\nResolution:\n51.1\nconsolidate and divide all or any of its share capital into Shares of larger par value than its existing\nShares;\n51.2\nsub divide its existing Shares, or any of them, into Shares of smaller par value than is fixed by the Memorandum, subject nevertheless to the provisions of section\n13 of the Law;\n51.3\ncancel any Shares which, at the date of the passing of the resolution, have not been taken or agreed to be taken by any person;\nand\n51.4\nconvert all or any paid up Shares into stock, and reconvert all or any stock into paid up Shares of any\ndenomination.\n52.\nThe Company may from time to time by Special\nResolution:\n52.1\ndivide its Shares into several classes and attach to such classes any preferential, deferred, or special rights or restrictions in accordance with these\nArticles;\n52.2\nchange the currency denomination of its share\ncapital;\n13\n52.3\nreduce its share capital and any capital redemption reserve fund in any manner whatsoever;\nand\n52.4\nmerge or consolidate with any one or more constituent companies (as defined in the Law).\nGENERAL MEETINGS\nConvening a meeting\n53.\nThe Directors may, whenever they think fit, convene an extraordinary general meeting.
