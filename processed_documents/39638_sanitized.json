References to this Agreement and to agreements and contractual instruments will be deemed to include all exhibits, schedules, appTerminationices, annexes, and other attachments thereto and all subsequent amTerminationments and other modifications to such instruments, to the extent such amTerminationments and other modifications are not prohibited by the terms of this Agreement. 1.2.3 The word “include” or “including” will be deemed to be followed by “without limitation.” The term “will” has the same meaning as “shall,” and thus imposes an obligation. 1.2.4 Whenever the context so requires, the singular includes the plural and the plural includes the singular, and the gTerminationer of any pronoun includes the other gTerminationer. 1.2.5 Unless otherwise indicated, references to any statute, regulation or other law will be deemed to refer to such statute, regulation or other law as amTerminationed or any successor law. 1.2.6 Unless otherwise indicated, references to a Person shall include such Person’s successors and permitted assigns. 1.2.7 Unless otherwise indicated, any reference to a time of Day shall be to Central Time in the United States of America. 1.2.8 Approximate conversions of any unit of measurement contained in parenthesis following the primary unit of measurement included in Sections 1 through 25 of this Agreement are inserted as a matter of operational convenience only to show the approximate equivalent in such different measurement. The obligations of the Parties under Sections 1 through 25 of this Agreement will be undertaken in respect of the primary unit of measurement and not in respect of any such approximate conversion.",

Any Expert selected shall be instructed to select the published rate or index, or a combination of published rates or indices, with adjustments as necessary or appropriate, that most nearly preserves the intent and economic result of the original rates or indices. If the Parties are not able to agree upon an Expert within ten (10) Days after the receipt of the notice of request for expert determination, either Party may elect to refer the determination of the replacement rate or index for Dispute Resolution in accordance with Section 20.1. 1.3.3 If any rate used in this Agreement is not published for a particular date, but the publication containing such rate continues to be published and the rate itself continues to exist, the Parties shall use the published rate in effect for the date such rate was most recently published prior to the particular date, unless otherwise provided in this Agreement. 1.3.4 If any index used in this Agreement is not published for a particular date, but the publication containing such index continues to be published and the index itself continues to exist, the Parties shall use the published rate in effect for the date such rate was most recently published prior to the particular date, unless otherwise provided in this Agreement. If the index is subsequently published for the particular date, such published index will be substituted for the previously-used index and any calculations involving such index will be recalculated and the Parties will take any necessary actions based upon these revised calculations, including adjustments of amounts previously invoiced or paid. 1.3.5 If an incorrect value is published for any rate or index used in this Agreement and such error is corrected and published within ninety (90) Days of the date of the publication of such incorrect rate or index, such corrected rate or index will be substituted for the incorrect rate or index and any calculations involving such rate or index will be recalculated and the Parties will take any necessary actions based upon these revised calculations, including adjustments of amounts previously invoiced or paid. 1.3.6 Either Party may provide to the other Party notice at any time if such notifying Party reasonably believes that JKM has, when compared with JKM as at the Effective Date, ceased to be representative of the value of LNG delivered on a spot basis in China, Korea, Taiwan and Japan, due to a material decrease 18 in (a) index liquidity and/ or (b) the number and range of participating counterparties. Following such notice, the Parties shall meet (such meeting the “JKM Meeting”) and discuss whether or not to replace JKM with a replacement index or methodology which maintains the Parties in a similar commercial position as they were when using JKM. If the Parties are unable to agree within thirty (30) Days of such notice, the Parties shall refer the matter to their respective senior management for resolution thereof. If senior management of the Parties are unable to agree within thirty (30) Days of such referral, then either Party may seek to resolve the Dispute through Dispute Resolution in accordance with Section 20, which Dispute Resolution shall be limited to deciding (x) whether JKM has, when compared with JKM as at the Effective Date, ceased to be representative of the value of LNG delivered on a spot basis in China, Korea, Taiwan and Japan due to a material decrease in (a) index liquidity and/or (b) the number and range of participating counterparties and (y) if so, the replacement index or methodology to be applied which maintains the Parties in a similar commercial position as they were when using JKM, or whether to retain the use JKM. Upon the earlier to occur of (i) a final decision being handed down by the arbitrators to substitute JKM with a replacement index or methodology; or (ii) a new index or methodology is agreed between the Parties or, as applicable, their respective senior management, such new index or methodology shall be applied retroactively from the date of the first JKM Meeting and shall be applied to all invoices issued on and from the date of the first JKM Meeting.",

Priority within this group shall be given to the LNG vessel which has first tTerminationered to Driftwood its NOR. Once an LNG vessel achieves a first berthing priority pursuant to this Section 7.11.2(a) or 7.11.2(c), such LNG vessel shall maintain such priority until such LNG vessel is berthed, so long as its tTerminationered NOR does not become invalid pursuant to Section 7.13.1; 42 (b) The second berthing priority for a delivery window period shall be for an LNG vessel scheduled for arrival before such delivery window period, which tTerminationered to Driftwood its NOR prior to or during its scheduled delivery window but which was unable to proceed to berth for reasons not attributable to Buyer, the Transporter, the LNG Tanker or its master, crew, owner or operator. Priority within this group shall be given to the LNG vessel which has first tTerminationered to Driftwood its NOR; and (c) The third berthing priority for a delivery window period shall be for an LNG vessel scheduled for arrival after such delivery window period. Priority within this group shall be given to the LNG vessel which has first tTerminationered to Driftwood its NOR. An LNG vessel with third berthing priority pursuant to this Section 7.11.2(c) will achieve a first berthing priority on its scheduled delivery window pursuant to Section 7.11.2(a) if such LNG vessel has not been berthed prior to such date, so long as its tTerminationered NOR does not become invalid pursuant to Section 7.13.1. 7.11.3 If an LNG Tanker tTerminationers NOR after the Termination of its Delivery Window, Seller shall use reasonable efforts to berth or cause to be berthed such LNG Tanker as soon as reasonably practical; provided, however, that, unless otherwise agreed with Buyer, Seller shall have no obligation to use such efforts to berth or cause to be berthed an LNG Tanker that tTerminationers NOR more than forty-eight (48) hours after the Termination of its Delivery Window.

When an unready LNG Tanker at anchorage becomes ready for LNG loading, its master shall notify Seller and Driftwood. If, as a result of such LNG Tanker not being ready to berth for reasons not attributable to Seller, Driftwood or the operator of the Driftwood LNG Terminal, Buyer fails to take a cargo, the provisions 45 of Sections 5.7.2 to 5.7.7 shall apply. If, as a result of such LNG Tanker not being ready to berth for reasons attributable to Seller or Driftwood, Buyer fails to take a cargo, Seller shall be deemed to have failed to make available such cargo and the provisions of Sections 5.6.2 to 5.6.4 shall apply. 7.13.2 The following shall apply with respect to berthing: (a) An LNG Tanker shall complete LNG loading and vacate the berth as soon as possible but not later than thirty (30) hours from the time the LNG Tanker is all fast at the berth and has received all required Approvals from the relevant Governmental Authorities (including security clearance from the US Coast Guard). Such thirty (30) hour-period (“Allowed Laytime”) shall be extTerminationed by any period of delay that is caused by: (i) reasons attributable to a Governmental Authority, Seller, Driftwood, the operator of the Driftwood LNG Terminal or any Third Party outside the reasonable control of Buyer, the Transporter, the LNG Tanker or its master, crew, owner or operator; (ii) Force Majeure or Adverse Weather Conditions; (iii) unscheduled curtailment or temporary discontinuation of operations at the Driftwood LNG Terminal necessary for reasons of safety, except to the extent such unscheduled curtailment or temporary discontinuation of operations is attributable to Buyer, the Transporter, the LNG Tanker or its master, crew, owner or operator; (iv) time at berth during any cool-down pursuant to Sections 7.16.1(a)-(c); (v) time at berth during any gas-up pursuant to Section 7.17; (vi) nighttime transit restrictions, if applicable; (vii) tidal restrictions; and (viii) any other interruption impacting the Loading Port, including the unavailability or delay of Pilot services, tugs, and other similar interruptions, to the extent such interruptions are not caused by reasons attributable to Buyer, the Transporter, the LNG Tanker or its master, crew, owner or operator. (b) If an LNG Tanker fails to depart at the Termination of its Allowed Laytime (as extTerminationed pursuant to Sections 7.13.2(a)(i)-(viii)), another LNG 46 vessel is awaiting the berth and the LNG Tanker’s continued occupancy of the berth will disrupt the overall berthing schedule of the Driftwood LNG Terminal or operations of the Driftwood LNG Terminal, Driftwood may direct (or cause Seller to direct) the LNG Tanker to vacate the berth and proceed to sea at utmost dispatch. (c) If an LNG Tanker fails to depart the berth at the Termination of its Allowed Laytime (as extTerminationed pursuant to Sections 7.13.2(a)(i)-(viii)) and as a result the subsequent LNG vessel is prevented from or delayed in loading, Buyer shall reimburse Seller for any and all actual documented demurrage or excess boil-off that Seller becomes contractually obligated to pay to any Third Party with respect to such subsequent LNG vessel, as a result of the LNG Tanker not completing LNG loading and vacating the berth as required by this Section 7.13.2; provided that Buyer shall not be required to reimburse Seller for any amounts based on a demurrage rate or excess boil-off rate in excess of those specified in Section 7.12.3 and Section 7.12.4, as applicable.

Neither Party shall be liable to the other Party hereunder as a result of any act or omission in the course of or in connection with the performance of this Agreement, for or in respect of: (a) any indirect, incidental, consequential or exemplary losses; (b) any loss of income or profits; (c) except as expressly provided in this Agreement, any failure of performance or delay in performance to the extent relieved by the application of Force Majeure in accordance with Section 14; or 72 (d) except as expressly provided in this Agreement, any losses arising from any claim, demand or action made or brought against the other Party by a Third Party. 15.2.2 Exclusive Remedies. A Party’s sole liability, and the other Party’s exclusive remedy, arising under or in connection with Sections 5.6, 5.7, 7.12.3, 7.12.4, 7.13.2(c) and 12.3 and this Section 15 shall be as set forth in each such provision, respectively. 15.2.3 Liquidated Damages. The Parties agree that it would be impracticable to determine accurately the extent of the loss, damage and expTerminationiture that either Party would have in the circumstances described in Sections 5.6, 5.7, 7.12.3 and 7.12.4. Accordingly, the Parties have estimated and agreed in advance that the sole liability, and exclusive remedy for such circumstances shall be as provided in those Sections, and neither Party shall have additional liability as a result of any such circumstances. Each amount described in or determined by the provisions of Sections 5.6, 5.7, 7.12.3 and 7.12.4 is intTerminationed to represent a genuine pre-estimate by the Parties as to the loss or damage likely to be suffered by the Party receiving the payment or benefit in each such circumstance. Each Party waives any right to claim or assert, in any Dispute Resolution or expert determination pursuant to Section 20 in any action with respect to this Agreement, that any of the exclusive remedies set forth in Sections 5.6, 5.7, 7.12.3 and 7.12.4 do not represent a genuine pre-estimate by the Parties as to the loss or damage likely to be suffered by the Party receiving the payment or benefit in each such circumstance or otherwise are not valid and enforceable damages. 15.2.4 Express Remedies. The Parties agree that Section 15.2.1 shall not impair a Party’s obligation to pay the amounts specified in, or the validity of or limitations imposed by, Sections 5.6, 5.7, 7.12.3, 7.12.4, 7.13.2(c) and 12.3. Neither Party shall have a right to make a claim for actual damages (whether direct or indirect) or other non-specified damages under any circumstances for which an express remedy or measure of damages is provided in this Agreement. 15.2.5 Remedies in Contract. Except with respect to claims for injunctive relief under Sections 18 and 20.1.11, a Party’s sole remedy against the other Party for nonperformance or breach of this Agreement or for any other claim of whatsoever nature arising out of or in relation to this Agreement shall be in contract and no Party shall be liable to another Party (or its Affiliates and contractors and their respective members, directors, officers, employees and agents) in respect of any damages or losses suffered or claims which arise out of, under or in any alleged breach of statutory duty or tortious act or omission or otherwise. 73 15.2.6 Seller Aggregate Liability for Certain Events. (a) Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, the maximum Seller Aggregate Liability as of any given date in respect of any occurrence or series of occurrences shall not exceed the Seller Liability Cap. (b) “Seller Aggregate Liability” shall mean, as of any date of determination, any and all liability of Seller to Buyer under this Agreement, excluding (i) any Seller liabilities under this Agreement for which Seller has already made payment to Buyer as of such date and (ii) any liability caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Seller or any Affiliate of Seller. (c) The “Seller Liability Cap”, as of any given time of determination, shall be an amount (in USD) equal to USD one hundred and fifty million (US$ 150,000,000). 15.2.7 EXCEPT FOR Representations Warranties OF (I) TITLE AND (II) NO LIENS OR ENCUMBRANCES, AND SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT CONCERNING THE QUALITY OF LNG TO BE DELIVERED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, SELLER EXPRESSLY NEGATES ANY WARRANTY WITH RESPECT TO LNG DELIVERED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, WRITTEN OR ORAL, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY WITH RESPECT TO CONFORMITY TO SAMPLES, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE.",

Buyer shall provide Seller or its designee, or cause Seller or its designee to be provided, with a certified copy of tank gauge tables for each tank of each LNG Tanker verified by a competent impartial authority or authorities mutually agreed upon by the Parties. Such tables shall include correction tables for list, trim, tank contraction and any other items requiring such tables for accuracy of gauging. Tank gauge tables prepared pursuant to the above shall indicate volumes in cubic meters expressed to the nearest thousandth (1/1000), with LNG tank depths expressed in meters to the nearest hundredth (1/100). b) Presence of Representatives. Seller and Buyer shall each have the right to have representatives present at the time each LNG tank on each LNG Tanker is volumetrically calibrated. c) Recalibration. If the LNG tanks of any LNG Tanker suffer distortion of such nature as to create a reasonable doubt regarding the validity of the tank gauge tables described herein (or any subsequent calibration provided for herein), Buyer or Buyer’s agent shall recalibrate the damaged tanks, and the vessel shall not be employed as an LNG Tanker hereunder until appropriate corrections are made. If mutually agreed between Buyer and Seller representatives, recalibration of damaged tanks can be deferred until the next time when such damaged tanks are warmed for any reason, and any corrections to the prior tank gauge tables will be made from the time the distortion occurred. If the time of the distortion cannot be ascertained, the Parties shall mutually agree on the time period for retrospective adjustments. 5. Units of Measurement and Calibration The Parties shall co-operate in the design, selection and acquisition of devices to be used for measurements and tests in order that all measurements and tests may be conducted in the SI system of units, except for the quantity delivered which is expressed in MMBtu, the Gross Heating Value (volume based) which is expressed in Btu/SCF and the pressure which is expressed in millibar and A-2 temperature in Celsius. In the event that it becomes necessary to make measurements and tests using a new system of units of measurements, the Parties shall establish agreed upon conversion tables. 6. Accuracy of Measurement All measuring equipment must be maintained, calibrated and tested in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommTerminationations. In the absence of a manufacturer’s recommTerminationation, the minimum frequency of calibration shall be one hundred eighty (180) days, unless otherwise mutually agreed between the Parties. Documentation of all tests and calibrations will be made available by the Party performing the same to the other Party. Acceptable accuracy and performance tolerances shall be: a) Liquid Level Gauging Devices. Each LNG tank of the LNG Tanker shall be equipped with primary and secondary liquid level gauging devices as per Paragraph 7(b) of this Exhibit A. The measurement accuracy of the primary gauging devices shall be plus or minus seven point five (± 7.5) millimeters and the secondary liquid level gauging devices shall be plus or minus ten (± 10) millimeters. The liquid level in each LNG tank shall be logged or printed. b) Temperature Gauging Devices. The temperature of the LNG and of the vapor space in each LNG tank shall be measured by means of a number of properly located temperature measuring devices sufficient to permit the determination of average temperature. The measurement accuracy of the temperature gauging devices shall be as follows: (i) in the temperature range of minus one hundred sixty-five to minus one hundred forty degree Celsius (-165 C to -140 °C), the accuracy shall be plus or minus zero point two degree Celsius  (± 0.2 °C); (ii) in the temperature range of minus one hundred forty to plus forty degrees Celsius (-140C to +40 °C), the accuracy shall be plus or minus one point five degree Celsius (± 1.5 °C). The temperature in each LNG tank shall be logged or printed. c) Pressure Gauging Devices. Each LNG tank of the LNG Tanker shall have one (1) absolute pressure gauging device. The measurement accuracy of the pressure gauging device shall be plus or minus one percent (± 1%) of the measuring range. A-3 The pressure in each LNG tank shall be logged or printed. d) List and Trim Gauging Devices. A list gauging device and a trim gauging device shall be installed. These shall be interfaced with the custody Assignment system. The measurement of list shall be conducted to the nearest zero decimal one (0.1) degree. The measurement of trim shall be conducted to the nearest zero decimal zero two (0.02) meter. 7. Gauging and Measuring LNG Volumes Delivered a) Gauge Tables. Upon Seller’s representative and the indepTerminationent surveyor, if present, arriving on board the LNG Tanker prior to the commencement of or during loading, Buyer or Buyer’s representative shall make available to them a certified copy of tank gauge tables for each tank of the LNG Tanker. b) Gauges. Volumes of LNG delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall be determined by gauging the LNG in the tanks of the LNG Tankers before and after loading. Each LNG Tanker’s tank shall be equipped with a minimum of two (2) indepTerminationent sets of level gauges, each set utilizing preferably a different measurement principle. Comparison of the two (2) systems, designated as Primary and Secondary Measurement Systems, shall be performed from time to time to ensure compliance with the acceptable performance tolerances stated herein. c) Gauging Process. Gauging the liquid in the tanks of the LNG Tankers and measuring of liquid temperature, vapor temperature and vapor pressure in each LNG tank, trim and list of the LNG Tankers, and atmospheric pressure shall be performed, or caused to be performed, by Buyer before and after loading. Seller’s representative shall have the right to be present while all measurements are performed and shall verify the accuracy and acceptability of all such measurements. The first gauging and measurements shall be made immediately before the commencement of loading. The second gauging and measurements shall take place immediately after the completion of loading. d) Records. Copies of gauging and measurement records shall be furnished to Seller immediately upon completion of the loading report from the indepTerminationent surveyor. e) Gauging Liquid Level of LNG. The level of the LNG in each LNG tank of the LNG Tanker shall be gauged by means of both the primary and secondary gauging devices installed in the LNG Tanker for that purpose, with the secondary gauging device as a back-up in case the primary device fails for any reason. The level of the LNG in each tank shall be logged or printed. Measurement of the liquid level in each LNG tank of the LNG Tanker shall be made to the nearest millimeter by using the primary liquid level gauging devices. Should the primary device fail for any of the measurements, the secondary device shall be used. A-4 Five (5) readings shall be made following manufacturer’s recommTerminationations on reading interval. The arithmetic average of the readings rounded to the nearest millimeter using one (1) decimal place shall be deemed the liquid level. f) Determination of Temperature. The temperature of the LNG and of the vapor space in each LNG tank shall be measured by means of a sufficient number of properly located temperature measuring devices to permit the determination of average temperature. Temperatures shall be measured at the same time as the liquid level measurements and shall be logged or printed. In order to determine the temperature of liquid and vapor respectively in the LNG Tanker one (1) reading shall be taken at each temperature gauging device in each LNG tank. An arithmetic average of such readings rounded to the nearest zero point one degree Celsius (0.1 °C) using two (2) decimal places with respect to vapor and liquid in all LNG tanks shall be deemed the final temperature of the vapor and liquid respectively. Buyer shall cause each cargo tank in the LNG Tanker to be provided with a minimum of five (5) temperature measuring devices. One such measuring device shall be located in the vapor space at the top of each cargo tank, one near the bottom of each cargo tank and the remainder distributed at appropriate intervals from the top to the bottom of the cargo tank. These devices shall be used to determine the average temperatures of the liquid cargo and the vapor in the cargo tank. The average temperature of the vapor in an LNG Tanker shall be determined immediately before loading by means of the temperature measuring devices specified above at the same time as when the liquid level is measured. The temperature measuring devices shall be fully surrounded by the vapor. This determination shall be made by taking the temperature readings of the temperature measuring devices in question to the nearest zero point zero one degrees Celsius (0.01°C), and if more than one of the devices are fully surrounded by the vapor, by averaging those readings, and rounding to one (1) decimal place. The average temperature of the liquid in an LNG Tanker shall be determined immediately after loading by means of the temperature measuring devices specified above. g) Determination of Pressure. The pressure of the vapor in each LNG tank shall be determined by means of pressure measuring devices installed in each LNG tank of the LNG Tankers. The atmospheric pressure shall be determined by readings from the standard barometer installed in the LNG Tankers. Pressures shall be measured at the same time as the liquid level measurements, and shall be logged or printed. Buyer shall cause the LNG Tanker to be provided with pressure measuring equipment capable of determining the absolute pressure of the vapor in each cargo tank with an accuracy equal to or better than plus or minus one percent (± 1%) of the measuring range. The pressure of the vapor in an LNG Tanker shall be determined immediately before loading at the same time as when the liquid level is measured. A-5 Such determination shall be made by taking the pressure readings of the pressure measuring devices to the nearest millibar, then averaging these readings and rounding to a whole millibar. h) Determination of Density. The LNG density shall be calculated using the revised Klosek-McKinley method. Should any improved data, method of calculation or direct measurement device become available which is acceptable to both Buyer and Seller, such improved data, method or device shall then be used. 8. Samples for Quality Analysis a) General. Representative liquid samples shall be collected continuously and at an even flow proportional rate during the period of stable loading in accordance with ISO 8943 using a sampler of a design proven in service and customarily in use in the LNG industry. Either continuous on-line gas chromatography or off-line gas chromatography analysis of retained samples shall be used for custody Assignment purposes in accordance with the customary practices and procedures at the Driftwood LNG Terminal. The resulting analyses, which are generally proportional to time, will be arithmetically averaged to yield an analysis that is representative of the loaded LNG cargo. This arithmetically averaged analysis shall be used for all appropriate calculations associated with the delivered LNG cargo. If both Seller and Buyer agree that the result of the arithmetic average does not give a fair representation of the composition of the LNG, both Parties shall meet and decide in good faith the appropriate method to determine the composition of the LNG. Should the automatic sampling system fail during the loading, manual samples shall be collected and analyzed for accounting purposes. b) Manual Samples. Prior to the Termination of the loading cycle, three (3) sets of spot samples shall be collected from the vaporizer at the following intervals during loading, when loading is twenty-five percent (25%), fifty percent (50%), and seventy-five percent (75%) complete. Spot samples shall be collected in accordance with Gas Processors Association (“GPA”) Standard 2166 - Methods for Obtaining Gas Samples for Analysis by Gas Chromatography - or by other mutually agreeable methods. The samples shall be properly labeled and then distributed to Buyer and Seller. Seller shall retain one (1) sample for a period of forty (40) days, unless the analysis is in dispute. If the analysis is in dispute, the sample will be retained until the dispute is resolved. Sampling and analysis methods and procedures that differ from the above may be employed with the mutual agreement of the Parties. 9. Quality Analysis a) Certification and Deviation. Chromatograph calibration gasses shall be provided and their composition certified by an indepTerminationent third party. From time to time, deviation checks shall be performed to verify the accuracy of the gas composition mole percentages and resulting calculated physical properties. Analyses of a sample of test gas of known composition resulting when procedures that are in accordance with the above mentioned standards have been applied will be considered as acceptable if the resulting calculated gross heating value is within plus or minus zero point three percent (± 0. 3%) of the known gross heating value of the test gas sample. If the deviation exceeds the tolerance stated, the gross real heating value, relative density and compressibility A-6 previously calculated will be corrected immediately. Previous analyses will be corrected to the point where the error occurred, if this can be positively identified to the satisfaction of both Parties. Otherwise it shall be assumed that the drift has been linear since the last recalibration and correction shall be based on this assumption. b) GPA Standard 2261. All samples shall be analyzed by Seller to determine the molar fraction of the hydrocarbon and other components in the sample by gas chromatography using a mutually agreed method in accordance with GPA Standard 2261 - Method of Analysis for Gas and Similar Gaseous Mixtures by Gas Chromatography, current as of January 1st, 1990 and as periodically updated or as otherwise mutually agreed by the Parties. If better standards for analysis are subsequently adopted by GPA or other recognized competent impartial authority, upon mutual agreement of Buyer and Seller, they shall be substituted for the standard then in use, but such substitution shall not take place retroactively. A calibration of the chromatograph or other analytical instrument used shall be performed by Seller immediately prior to the analysis of the sample of LNG delivered. Seller shall give advance notice to Buyer of the time Seller intTerminations to conduct a calibration thereof, and Buyer shall have the right to have a representative present at each such calibration; provided, however, Seller will not be obligated to defer or reschedule any calibration in order to permit the representative of Buyer to be present. c) GPA Standard 2377 and 2265. Seller shall determine the presence of Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S) by use of GPA Standard 2377 - Test of Hydrogen Sulfide and Carbon Dioxide in Gas Using Length of Stain Tubes. If necessary, the concentration of H2S and total sulfur will be determined using one or more of the following methods as is appropriate: gas chromatography, Gas Processors Standard 2265 - Standard for Determination of Hydrogen Sulfide and Mercaptan Sulfur in Gas (Cadmium Sulfate - Iodometric Titration Method) or any other method that is mutually acceptable. If Hydrogen Sulfide or Carbon Dioxide are detected by the above methods then Seller shall confirm the presence of Hydrogen Sulfide or Carbon Dioxide in accordance with GPA Standard 2261-00 (Analysis for Natural Gas and Similar Gaseous Mixtures by Gas Chromatography). 10. Operating Procedures a) Notice. Prior to conducting operations for measurement, gauging, sampling and analysis provided in this Exhibit A, the Party responsible for such operations shall notify the appropriate representatives of the other Party, allowing such representatives reasonable opportunity to be present for all operations and computations; provided that the absence of the other Party’s representative after notification and opportunity to attTermination shall not prevent any operations and computations from being performed. b) IndepTerminationent Surveyor. At the request of either Party any measurement, gauging, sampling and analysis shall be witnessed and verified by an indepTerminationent surveyor mutually agreed upon by Buyer and Seller. The results of such surveyor’s verifications shall be made available promptly to each Party. c) Preservation of Records. All records of measurement and the computed results shall be preserved by the Party responsible for taking the same, or causing the same to be taken, and made A-7 available to the other Party for a period of not less than three (3) years after such measurement and computation. 11. Quantities Delivered a) Calculation of MMBtu Quantities. The quantity of MMBtu delivered shall be calculated by Seller and verified by Buyer. Either Party may, at its own expense, require the measurements and calculations and/or their verification by an indepTerminationent surveyor mutually agreed upon by the Parties. Consent to an indepTerminationent surveyor proposed by a Party shall not be unreasonably withheld by the other Party. b) Determination of Gross Heating Value. All component values shall be in accordance with the latest revision of GPA Standard 2145 SI (2009) - Physical Constants for Hydrocarbons & Other Compounds of Interest to the Natural Gas Industry and the latest revision of the reference standards therein. Standard reference conditions for Hi component should be 15°C & 101.325 kPa. c) Determination of Volume of LNG Loaded. (i) The LNG volume in the tanks of the LNG Tanker before and after loading (valves have to be closed) shall be determined by gauging on the basis of the tank gauge tables provided for in Paragraph 6. During the period when measurement is occurring, no LNG cargo, ballast, boil-off gas, fuel oil or other cargo Assignment activity will be carried out on the LNG Tanker. Measurements shall first be made immediately before loading commences. Accordingly, after connection of the loading arms, but prior to their cool down, and immediately before opening the manifold ESD valves of the LNG Tanker, the initial gauging shall be conducted upon the confirmation of stoppage of all spray pumps and compressors and shut-off of the gas master valve to the LNG Tanker’s boilers or any other gas consuming unit. The Gas master valve to the LNG Tanker’s boilers or any other Gas-consuming unit on the LNG Tanker shall remain closed until after the second gauging, unless a regulatory change requires the consumption of Gas during the LNG Tanker loading operations and/or upon mutual agreement of the Parties, in which case Gas consumed during loading shall be taken into account in the calculations pursuant to Paragraph 12.4 of this Exhibit A. A second gauging shall be made immediately after loading is completed. Accordingly, the second gauging shall be conducted upon the confirmation of shut-off of the manifold ESD valves, with ship Assignment pumps off and allowing sufficient time for the liquid level to stabilize. The LNG Tanker’s lines, manifold and crossover lines shall be emptied (warm) before loading commences. If the crossover lines are liquid filled (cold) when measurement is taken before loading commences, such crossover lines will remain full (cold) until measurement is taken following the completion of loading. The volume of LNG remaining in the tanks immediately before loading of the LNG Tanker shall be subtracted from the volume immediately after loading and the resulting volume shall be taken as the volume of the LNG delivered from the terminal to the LNG Tanker. The volume of LNG stated in cubic meters to the nearest zero point zero zero one (0.001) cubic meter, shall be determined by using the tank gauge tables and by applying the volume corrections set forth therein. A-8 (ii) Gas returned to the terminal during loading and Gas consumed by the LNG Tanker during loading shall be taken into account to determine the volume loaded for Buyer’s account in accordance with the formula in Paragraph 12.4 of this Exhibit A – MMBtu Calculation of the Quantity of LNG Loaded. (iii) If failure of the primary gauging and measuring devices of an LNG Tanker should make it impossible to determine the LNG volume, the volume of LNG loaded shall be determined by gauging the liquid level using the secondary gauging and measurement devices. If an LNG Tanker is not so equipped, the volume of LNG loaded shall be determined by gauging the liquid level in the Driftwood LNG Terminal’s onshore LNG storage tanks immediately before and after loading the LNG Tanker, in line with the terminal procedures, and such volume shall have subtracted from it an estimated LNG volume, agreed upon by the Parties, for boil-off from such tanks during the loading of such LNG Tanker. Seller shall provide Buyer, or cause Buyer to be provided with, a certified copy of tank gauge tables for each onshore LNG tank which is to be used for this purpose, such tables to be verified by a competent impartial authority. 12. Calculations The calculation procedures contained in this Paragraph 12 are generally in accordance with the Institute of Petroleum Measurement Manual, Part XII, the Static Measurement of Refrigerated Hydrocarbon Liquids, Section 1, IP 251/76. d = density of LNG loaded at the prevailing composition and temperature Tl in kg/m3, rounded to two (2) decimal places, calculated according to the method specified in Paragraph 12.1 of this Exhibit A. Hi = gross heating value (mass based) of component “i” in MJ/kg, in accordance with Paragraph 12.6(a) of this Exhibit A. Hm = gross heating value (mass based) of the LNG loaded in MJ/kg, calculated in accordance with the method specified in Paragraph 12.3 of this Exhibit A, rounded to four (4) decimal places. Hv = gross heating value (volume based) of the LNG loaded in Btu/SCF, calculated in accordance with the method specified in Paragraph 12.5 of this Exhibit A. K1 = volume correction in m3/kmol, at temperature Tl, obtained by linear interpolation from Paragraph 12.6(c) of this Exhibit A, rounded to six (6) decimal places. K2 = volume correction in m3/kmol, at temperature Tl obtained by linear interpolation from Paragraph 12.6(d) of this Exhibit A, rounded to six (6) decimal places. Mi = molecular mass of component “i” in kg/kmol, in accordance with Paragraph 12.6(a) of this Exhibit A. P = average absolute pressure of vapor in an LNG Tanker immediately before loading, in millibars, rounded to a whole millibar. A-9 Q = number of MMBtu contained in the LNG delivered, rounded to the nearest ten (10) MMBtu. Tl = average temperature of the liquid cargo in the LNG Tanker immediately after loading, in degrees Celsius, rounded to one (1) decimal place. Tv = average temperature of the vapor in an LNG Tanker immediately before loading, in degrees Celsius, rounded to one (1) decimal place. V = the volume of the liquid cargo loaded, in cubic meters, rounded to three (3) decimal places. Vh = the volume of the liquid cargo in an LNG Tanker immediately before loading, in cubic meters, rounded to three (3) decimal places. Vb = the volume of the liquid cargo in an LNG Tanker immediately after loading, in cubic meters, rounded to three (3) decimal places. Vi = molar volume of component “i” at temperature Tl, in m3/kmol, obtained by linear interpolation from Paragraph 12.6(b) of this Exhibit A, rounded to six (6) decimal places. Xi = molar fraction of component “i” of the LNG samples taken from the loading line, rounded to four (4) decimal places, determined by gas chromatographic analysis. Xm = the value of Xi for methane. Xn = the value of Xi for nitrogen. 12.1 Density Calculation Formula The density of the LNG loaded which is used in the MMBtu calculation in Paragraph 12.4 of this Exhibit A shall be calculated from the following formula derived from the revised Klosek-McKinley method: d = Σ (Xi x Mi) Σ (Xi x Vi) - [ K1+ (K2-K1) x Xn ] x Xm 0.0425 In the application of the above formula, no intermediate rounding shall be made if the accuracy of “d” is thereby affected. 12.2 Calculation of Volume Delivered The volume, in cubic meters, of each LNG cargo loaded shall be calculated by using the following formula: A-10 V = Vb - Vh 12.3 Calculation of Gross Heating Value (Mass Based) The gross heating value (mass based), in MJ/kg, of each LNG cargo loaded shall be calculated by using the following formula: Hm = Σ (Xi x Mi x Hi) Σ (Xi x Mi) 12.4 MMBtu Calculation of the Quantity of LNG Loaded The number of MMBtu contained in the LNG loaded shall be calculated using the following formula: Q = 1 x { (V x d x Hm) - ( V x 288.15 x P ) x 37.7 + QBOG } 1055.12 273.15 + Tv 1013.25 The derivation of the conversion factor 1/1055.12 in the formula in this Paragraph for the conversion of MJ into MMBtu is obtained from GPA-2145:1994 and IP-251:1976 as follows: (a) q(T,P) means the gross heating value (measured at temperature T and pressure P), contained in a given quantity of gas; (b) q(60°F, 14.696 psia) in MJ = 1/1.00006 x q(15°C, 1013.25 millibar) in MJ; (c) 1 MMBtu corresponds to 1055.06 MJ; (d) q(60°F, 14.696 psia) in MMBtu = 1/1055.06 x q(60°F, 14.696 psia) in MJ; and (e) Combining (b) and (d) above yields: q(60°F, 14.696 psia) in MMBtu = 1/1055.12 x q(15°C, 1013.25 millibar) in MJ. Hence the number of MJ derived shall be divided by 1055.12 to obtain the number of MMBtu for invoicing purposes. QBOG = the quantity of boil-off gas in MJ consumed by the LNG Tanker during loading, calculated as follows: QBOG = (V2 x 55.575) A-11 where: V2 = the quantity of Gas consumed by the LNG Tanker during loading (as calculated pursuant to the below formula), stated in kg and rounded to the nearest kg; and 55.575 = the heating value of the vapor (assumed to be 100% of methane) stated in MJ/kg at standard reference conditions (15˚C, 1.01325 bar) for both combustion & metering references (tables below). Quantity of Natural Gas Consumed by LNG Tanker (V2): The quantity of Gas consumed by the LNG Tanker during loading shall be computed by taking the initial and the final reading of Natural Gas Consumption Meter on board the LNG Tanker (i.e. final reading of Natural Gas Consumption Meter after completion of loading minus initial reading of Natural Gas Consumption Meter before the start of loading) and is calculated by using the following formula: V2 = Vf – Vi where: V2 = the quantity of Gas consumed by the LNG Tanker during loading, stated in kg; Vf = the reading of Natural Gas Consumption Meter on board the LNG Tanker after the completion of loading, stated in kg; and Vi = the reading of Natural Gas Consumption Meter on board the LNG Tanker before the start of loading, stated in kg. 12.5 Calculation of Gross Heating Value (Volume Based) The calculation of the Gross Heating Value (volume based) in Btu/SCF shall be derived from the same compositional analysis as is used for the purposes of calculating the Gross Heating Value (mass based) Hm and the following formula shall apply: Hv = 1.13285 x Σ (Xi x Mi x Hi) The derivation of the conversion factor 1.13285 for the conversion of MJ/kmol into Btu/SCF is obtained as follows: A-12 (a) molar gross heating value = å (Xi x Mi x Hi) MJ/kmol; (b) 1 kmol = 2.20462 lbmol; (c) 1 lbmol = 379.482 SCF; (d) hence 1 kmol = 836.614 SCF; and (e) Hv = 1,000,000 / (1055.12 x 836.614) x å (Xi x Mi x Hi) Btu/SCF 12.6 Data (a) Values of Hi and Mi Component Hi (in MJ/kg) Mi (in kg/kmol) Methane 55.575 16.0425 Ethane 51.951 30.0690 Propane 50.369 44.0956 Iso-Butane 49.388 58.1222 N-Butane 49.546 58.1222 Iso-Pentane 48.950 72.1488 N-Pentane 49.045 72.1488 N-Hexane 48.715 86.1754 Nitrogen 0 28.0134 Carbon Dioxide 0 44.0095 Oxygen 0 31.9988 Source: GPA Publication 2145 Sl-2009: “Table of Physical Properties for Hydrocarbons and Other Compounds of Interest to the Natural Gas Industry”.
