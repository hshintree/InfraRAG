The Directors may fix in advance a date as the record date to determine the Members entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of the Members and, for the purpose of determining the Members entitled to receive payment of any dividTermination, the Directors may, at or within 90 days prior to the date of the declaration of such dividTermination, fix a subsequent date as the record date for such determination. No fixed record date 11. If no such record date is fixed, the record date shall be the date on which notice of the meeting is sent or the date on which the resolution of the Directors declaring such dividTermination is adopted, as the case may be.

The instrument of Assignment of any Share shall be executed by or on behalf of the Assignmentor (and, if the Directors so determine, the Assignmentee). The Assignmentor shall be deemed to remain the holder of the Share until the name of the Assignmentee is entered in the Register of Members in respect of such Share. All instruments of Assignment, once registered, may be retained by the Company. 17. Subject to any applicable restrictions contained in these Articles, Shares shall be Assignmentred in any usual or common form approved by the Directors. Refusal to register Assignments 18. The Directors may, in their absolute discretion and without assigning any reason therefore, decline to register any Assignment of any Share. The Directors may require reasonable evidence to show the right of the Assignmentor to make the Assignment. 19. If the Directors decline to register a Assignment of Shares they shall sTermination notice of the refusal to the Assignmentee within one month after the date on which the Assignment was lodged with the Company. 20. The Directors may also suspTermination the registration of the Assignments at such times and for such periods as the Directors may from time to time determine. TRANSMISSION OF SHARES Transmission of Shares 21. If a Member dies, the survivor or survivors (where he was a joint holder), and the legal personal representative (where he was sole holder), shall be the only person recognised by the Company as having any title to the Share. The estate of a deceased Member is not thereby released from any liability in respect of any Share held by him, whether solely or jointly. For the purpose of this Article, legal personal representative means the person to whom probate or letters of administration has or have been granted in the Cayman Islands or, if there is no such person, such other person as the Directors may in their absolute discretion determine to be the person recognised by the Company for the purpose of this Article. Election by persons entitled on transmission 22. Any person becoming entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a Member or otherwise by operation of Governing Law may elect, upon such evidence being produced as may be required by the Directors as to his entitlement, either be registered himself as a Member in respect of the Share or, instead of being registered himself, to make such Assignment of the Share as the deceased or bankrupt Member could have made. 7 Manner of election 23. If the person so becoming entitled elects to be registered himself, he shall deliver or sTermination to the Company a notice in writing signed by him stating that he so elects. If he shall elect to Assignment the Shares, he shall signify his election by signing an instrument of Assignment of such Shares in favour of his Assignmentee. All the limitations, restrictions and provisions of these Articles relating to the right to Assignment and the registration of Assignments of Shares shall be applicable to any such notice or instrument of Assignment as aforesaid as if the death of the Member or other event giving rise to the transmission had not occurred and the notice or instrument of Assignment was an instrument of Assignment signed by such Member. Rights of persons entitled on transmission 24. A person becoming entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of the Member (or otherwise by operation of Governing Law), upon such evidence being produced as may be required by the Directors as to his entitlement, shall be entitled to the same dividTerminations and other monies payable in respect of the Share as he would be entitled if he were the holder of such Share. However, he shall not be entitled, until he becomes registered as the holder of such Share, to receive notices of or to attTermination or vote at general meetings of the Company or (except as aforesaid) to exercise any other rights or privileges of a Member. The Directors may at any time give notice requiring such person to elect either to be registered himself or to Assignment the Share and, if the notice is not complied with within sixty days, the Directors may thereafter withhold payment of all dividTerminations and other monies payable in respect of the Shares until the requirements of the notice have been complied with. REDEMPTION AND PURCHASE OF SHARES 25. Subject to the provisions of the Law and the Memorandum, the Company may: 25.1 purchase its own Shares (including any redeemable Shares) in such manner and on such terms as the Directors may agree with the relevant Member unless following such purchase there would no longer be any issued Shares and may make payment for such purchase or for any redemption of Shares in any manner authorised by the Law, including out of capital; and 25.2 reduce its share capital and any capital redemption reserve fund in any manner whatsoever. 8 VARIATION OF SHARE RIGHTS Variation of class rights 26. If at any time the share capital is divided into different classes of Shares, all or any of the special rights attached to any class of Shares (unless otherwise provided by the terms of issue of the Shares of that class) may be varied or abrogated with the consent in writing of the holders of not less than two thirds of the issued Shares of that class or with the sanction of a resolution passed by the holders of not less than two thirds of the issued Shares of that class as may be present in person or by proxy at a separate general meeting of the holders of the Shares of that class. To any such separate general meeting, all of the provisions of these Articles relating to general meetings shall mutatis mutandis apply, but so that the necessary quorum shall be any one or more persons holding or representing by proxy not less than one third of the issued Shares of the class and that any holder of Shares of the relevant class present in person or by proxy may demand a poll. Treatment of classes 27. For the purpose of a separate class meeting, the Directors may treat two or more of all classes of Shares as forming one class if they consider that such class of Shares would be affected in the same way by the proposals under consideration. Effect of Share issue on class rights 28. The rights conferred upon the holders of any Shares shall not, unless otherwise expressly provided in the rights attaching to such Shares, be deemed to be altered by the creation or issue of further Shares ranking pari passu therewith. NON-RECOGNITION OF TRUSTS 29. Except as required by the Law or these Articles, or under an order of a court of competent jurisdiction, the Company shall not be bound by or compelled to recognise in any way, even when notice thereof is given to it, any equitable, contingent, future or partial interest in any Share, or any other rights in respect of any Share other than an absolute right to the entirety thereof in the registered holder. 9 LIEN Lien generally 30. The Company shall have a first and paramount lien on every Share (not being a fully paid Share) for all moneys (whether presently payable or not) called or payable at a date fixed by or in accordance with the terms of issue of such Share in respect of that Share, and the Company shall also have a first and paramount lien on every Share (other than a fully paid up Share) standing registered in the name of a Member, whether singly or jointly with any other person for all debts and liabilities of a Member or his estate to the Company, whether the same shall have been incurred before or after notice to the Company of any interest of any person other than such Member, and whether the time for the payment or discharge of the same shall have actually arrived or not, and notwithstanding that the same are joint debts or liabilities of such Member or his estate and any other person, whether a Member or not. The Directors may at any time, either generally or in any particular case, waive any lien that has arisen or declare any Share to be wholly or in part exempt from the provisions of this Article. The Company's lien, if any, on a Share shall extTermination to all dividTerminations payable thereon. Enforcement 31. The Company may sell, in such manner as the Directors think fit, any Share on which the Company has a lien, provided a sum in respect of which the lien exists is presently payable, and is not paid within fourteen days after a notice in writing has been given to the registered holder  for the time being of the Share, demanding payment of the sum presently payable and giving notice of the intention to sell in default of such payment. Completion of sale 32. For giving effect to any such sale, the Directors may authorise any person to Assignment the Share sold to the purchaser thereof. The purchaser shall be registered as the holder of the Share comprised in any such Assignment and he shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money, nor shall his title to the Share be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings relating to the sale. Application of proceeds 33. The net proceeds of such sale shall be applied in payment or discharge of the debt or liability in respect of which the lien exists and as is presently payable, and any balance shall (subject to a like lien for debts or liabilities not presently payable as existed upon the Shares prior to the sale) be paid to the person who was the registered holder of the Share immediately before such sale. CALLS ON SHARES Calls on Shares generally 34. The Directors may from time to time make calls upon the Members in respect of any moneys unpaid on their Shares (whether in respect of the par value of the Shares or premium or otherwise and not, by the terms of issue thereof, made payable at a future date fixed by or in accordance with such terms of issue); and each Member shall (subject to the Company serving upon him at least 14 days’ notice specifying the time or times and place of payment) pay to the Company at the time or times and place so specified the amount called on his Shares. A call may be revoked or postponed by the Directors wholly or in part as the Directors may determine. A call shall be deemed to have been made at the time when the resolution of the Directors authorising the call was passed. 10 Payment 35. Payment of a call may be made by instalments on the direction of the Directors. 36. If a sum called in respect of a Share is not paid before or on the day appointed for payment thereof, the person from whom the sum is due shall pay interest on the sum from the day payment is due to the time of the actual payment at such rate as the Directors may determine, but the Directors may waive payment of such interest wholly or in part. 37. Any sum payable in respect of a Share on issue or allotment or at any fixed date, whether in respect of the par value of the Share or premium or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a call and if it is not paid all the relevant provisions as to payment of interest, forfeiture or otherwise of these Articles shall apply as if such sum had become due and payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified. 38. The Directors may issue Shares with different terms as to the amount and times of payment of calls. Liability of joint holders 39. The joint holders of a Share shall be jointly and severally liable to pay calls in respect thereof. Interest 40. The Directors may, if they think fit, receive from any Member willing to advance the same, all or any part of the moneys uncalled and unpaid upon any Shares held by him; and may (until the amount would otherwise become payable) pay interest at such rate (not exceeding six per cent without the sanction of the Company in general meeting) as may be agreed upon between the Member paying the sum in advance and the Directors. FORFEITURE OF SHARES Notice 41. If a Member fails to pay any call or instalment of a call by the date it becomes due and payable, the Directors may, at any time thereafter while such call or instalment remains unpaid, give notice to the Member requiring payment of the unpaid portion of the call or instalment, together with any accrued interest and expenses incurred by the Company by reason of such non-payment. 11 42. The notice shall specify where and by what date (not being less than the Termination of 14 days’ from the date of the notice) payment is to be made and shall state that if it is not complied with the Shares in respect of which the call was made will be liable to be forfeited. The Directors may accept the surrTerminationer of any Share liable to be forfeited hereunder and, in such case, references to these Articles to forfeiture shall include surrTerminationer. Forfeiture for non-compliance 43. If such notice is not complied with, any Share in respect of which the notice was given may thereafter, before the payment of all calls or instalments and interest due in respect thereof has been made, be forfeited by a resolution of the Directors. Such forfeiture shall include all dividTerminations declared, other distributions or other monies payable in respect of the forfeited Shares and not paid before the forfeiture. Forfeited Shares 44. A forfeited Share may be sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed of upon such terms and in such manner as the Directors shall think fit, and at any time before a sale, re-allotment or disposition, the forfeiture may be cancelled on such terms as the Directors think fit. Continued liability for forfeited Member 45. A person whose Shares have been forfeited shall cease to be a Member in respect of the forfeited Shares, but shall remain liable to pay to the Company all moneys which at the date of forfeiture were presently payable by him in respect of the Shares together with interest at such rate as the Directors may determine from the date of forfeiture until payment, but his liability shall cease if and when the Company receives payment in full of all amounts due in respect of the Shares. The Company may enforce payment without being under any obligation to make any allowance for the value of the Shares forfeited. Evidence of forfeiture 46. An affidavit in writing by a Director or Secretary of the Company that a Share has been duly forfeited on a specified date, shall be conclusive evidence of the facts stated in it as against all persons claiming to be entitled to the Share. The Company may receive the consideration, if any, given for the Share on any sale, re-allotment or disposition thereof and may authorise some person to execute a Assignment of the Share in favour of the person to whom the Share is sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed of, and he shall thereupon be registered as the holder of the Share, and shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money (if any) nor shall his title to the Share be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings in reference to the forfeiture, sale, re-allotment or disposition of the Share. 12 47. The provisions of these Articles as to forfeiture shall apply in the case of non-payment of any sum which, by the terms of issue of a Share, becomes payable at a fixed time, whether on account of the par value of the Share, or by way of premium or otherwise, as if the same had been made payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified to the Member. INCREASE OF CAPITAL 48. The Company may from time to time by Ordinary Resolution increase its share capital by such sum, to be divided into new Shares of such par value, and with such rights, priorities and privileges attached thereto as the resolution shall prescribe. 49. Subject to any directions given by the Company in a general meeting, all new Shares shall be at the disposal of the Directors in accordance with these Articles. 50. The new Shares shall be subject to the same provisions of these Articles with reference to the payment of calls, lien, forfeiture, Assignment, transmission and otherwise, as the Shares in the original share capital. ALTERATION OF CAPITAL 51. The Company may from time to time by Ordinary Resolution: 51.1 consolidate and divide all or any of its share capital into Shares of larger par value than its existing Shares; 51.2 sub divide its existing Shares, or any of them, into Shares of smaller par value than is fixed by the Memorandum, subject nevertheless to the provisions of section 13 of the Law; 51.3 cancel any Shares which, at the date of the passing of the resolution, have not been taken or agreed to be taken by any person; and 51.4 convert all or any paid up Shares into stock, and reconvert all or any stock into paid up Shares of any denomination. 52. The Company may from time to time by Special Resolution: 52.1 divide its Shares into several classes and attach to such classes any preferential, deferred, or special rights or restrictions in accordance with these Articles; 52.2 change the currency denomination of its share capital; 13 52.3 reduce its share capital and any capital redemption reserve fund in any manner whatsoever; and 52.4 merge or consolidate with any one or more constituent companies (as defined in the Law). GENERAL MEETINGS Convening a meeting 53. The Directors may, whenever they think fit, convene an extraordinary general meeting. If at any time there are not sufficient Directors capable of acting to form a quorum, any Director, or any one or more Members holding in the aggregate not less than one third of the total issued share capital of the Company entitled to vote, may convene an extraordinary general meeting in the same manner as nearly as possible as that in which meetings may be convened by the Directors. Members’ requisition 54. The Directors shall, upon the requisition in writing of one or more Members holding in the aggregate not less than one tenth of such paid up capital of the Company as at the date of the requisition carries the right of voting at general meetings, convene an extraordinary general meeting. Any such requisition shall express the object of the meeting proposed to be called, and must be signed by the requisitionists and deposited at the Registered Office, and may consist of several documents in like form, each signed by one or more requisitionists. 55. If there are no Directors as at the date of the deposit of the Members’ requisition or if the Directors do not convene a general meeting within 21 days from the date of the deposit, the requisitionists or any or any of them or any other Member or Members holding in the aggregate not less than one tenth of such paid up capital of the Company as at the date of the requisition, may convene an extraordinary general meeting. A general meeting convened by requisitionists shall be convened in the same manner as nearly as possible as that in which general meetings are to be convened by the Directors. NOTICE OF GENERAL MEETINGS Length and form of notice 56. At least five clear days’ notice shall be given of any general meeting. Every notice shall specify the place, the day and the time of meeting and, in the case of special business, the general nature of the business to be conducted at the general meeting, and shall be given in the manner provided in these Articles or in such other manner (if any) as may be prescribed by the Company, to such persons as are entitled to receive such notices from the Company. A general meeting may be convened by such shorter notice, or without notice, by a majority in number of the Members having the right to attTermination and vote at the meeting, being a majority together holding not less than ninety-five percent in nominal value of the Shares giving that right. 14 Omission or non-receipt 57. The accidental omission to give notice of a meeting to, or the non-receipt of a notice of a meeting by, any Member entitled to receive notice shall not invalidate the proceedings at any meeting. PROCEEDINGS AT GENERAL MEETINGS 58. All business shall be deemed special that is transacted at an extraordinary general meeting. Quorum 59. No business shall be transacted at any general meeting unless a quorum of Members is present at the time that the meeting proceeds to business, but the absence of a quorum shall not preclude the appointment, choice or election of a chairman, which shall not be treated as part of the business of the Meeting. Save as herein otherwise provided, one or more Members holding in the aggregate not less than one third of the total issued share capital of the Company present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall be a quorum. Adjournment for lack of quorum 60. If within five minutes (or such longer time as the chairman of the meeting may determine to wait) after the time appointed for the meeting, a quorum is not present, the meeting, if convened upon the requisition of Members, shall be dissolved. In any other case, it shall stand adjourned to the same day in the next week, at the same time and place, and if at the adjourned meeting a quorum is not present within half an hour from the time appointed for the meeting, the Members present shall be a quorum. Meeting by telephone or other facilities 61. A meeting of the Members may be held by telephone, electronic or other communication facilities (including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, by telephone or video conferencing) by which all persons participating in the meeting can communicate with each other simultaneously and instantaneously, and participation in such a general meeting shall constitute presence in person at such meeting. 62. Any Director shall be entitled to attTermination and speak at any general meeting of the Company. 15 Appointment of chairman 63. The chairman (if any) of the Board of Directors shall preside as chairman at every general meeting of the Company. If there is no such chairman, or if at any meeting he is not present within five minutes after the time appointed for holding the meeting or is unwilling to act as chairman, the Directors present shall choose one of their number to act or, if only one Director is present, he shall preside as chairman if willing to act. If no Director is present, or if each of the Directors present declines to take the chair, the Members present and entitled to vote shall elect one of their number to be chairman. Adjournment of meeting 64. The chairman may, with the consent of a meeting at which a quorum is present (and shall if so directed by the meeting) adjourn the meeting from time to time and from place to place, but no business shall be transacted at any adjourned meeting other than the business left unfinished at the meeting from which the adjournment took place. When a meeting is adjourned for ten days or more, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given as in the case of an original meeting. Save as aforesaid, it shall not be necessary to give any notice of an adjournment or of the business to be transacted at an adjourned meeting. VOTING Ordinary Resolution Save where a Special Resolution or other greater majority is required by the Law or these Articles, any question proposed for consideration at any general meeting shall be decided by an Ordinary Resolution. Voting on a show of hands 65. At any general meeting, a resolution put to the vote of the meeting shall be decided on a show of hands, unless before or on the declaration of the result of the show of hands, or on the withdrawal of any other demand for a poll. Demand for poll 66. A poll is demanded by: 66.1 the chairman of the meeting; or 66.2 at least three Members present in person or by proxy; or 66.3 any Member or Members present in person or by proxy and holding collectively not less than one tenth of the total voting rights of all the Members having the right to vote at such meeting; or 16 66.4 a Member or Members present in person or by proxy holding Shares conferring the right to vote at such meeting, being Shares on which an aggregate sum has been paid up equal to not less than one tenth of the total sum paid up on all such Shares conferring such right. 67. Unless a poll is duly demanded and the demand is not withdrawn, a declaration by the chairman that a resolution has, on a show of hands, been carried or carried unanimously, or by a particular majority, or lost and an entry to that effect in the minutes of the proceedings of the Company shall be conclusive evidence of that fact, without proof of the number or proportion of the votes recorded in favour of, or against, that resolution. The demand for a poll may be withdrawn by the person or any persons making it at any time prior to the declaration of the result of the poll. 68. If a poll is duly demanded, it shall be taken in such manner as the chairman directs, and the result of the poll shall be deemed to be the resolution of the meeting at which the poll was demanded. 69. In the case of an equality of votes at a general meeting, whether on a show of hands or on a poll, the chairman of the meeting at which the show of hands takes place or at which the poll is demanded, shall not be entitled to a second or casting vote and the resolution shall fail. 70. A poll demanded on the election of a chairman or on a question of adjournment shall be taken forthwith. A poll demanded on any other question shall be taken in such manner and either forthwith or at such time later in the meeting as the chairman of the meeting shall direct. 71. The demand for a poll shall not prevent the continuance of a meeting for the transaction of any business other than the question on which the poll has been demanded and it may be withdrawn at any time before the close of the meeting or the taking of the poll, whichever is the earlier. Voting on a poll 72. On a poll votes may be cast either personally or by proxy. 73. A person entitled to more than one vote on a poll need not use all his votes or cast all the votes he uses in the same way. 74. On a show of hands, every Member present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall have one vote. On a poll, every Member present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall have one vote for each Share of which he is the registered holder. 17 75. In the case of joint holders of a Share, the vote of the senior who tTerminationers a vote, whether in person or by proxy, shall be accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint holders; and for this purpose seniority shall be determined by the order in which the names stand in the Register of Members in respect of the joint holding. 76. A Member of unsound mind, or, in respect of whom an order has been made by any court having jurisdiction in lunacy, may vote, whether on a show of hands or on a poll, by his receiver, committee, curator bonis or other person of similar nature appointed by such court, and any such receiver, committee, curator bonis or other person may vote by proxy and may otherwise act and be treated as such Member for the purpose of the general meetings. 77. No Member, unless the Directors otherwise determine, shall be entitled to vote at any general meeting, unless all calls or other sums presently payable by him in respect of Shares in the Company have been paid. 78. No objection shall be raised as to the qualification of any voter or as to whether any votes have been properly counted except at the general meeting or adjourned general meeting at which the vote objected to is given or tTerminationered and every vote not disallowed at the meeting shall be valid. Any objection made in due time and in accordance with these Articles shall be referred to the chairman whose decision shall be final and conclusive. Shareholder Restricted Matters 78A.

Such Secretary or other officers need not be Directors and in the case of the other officers may be ascribed such titles as the Directors may decide and the Directors may revoke or terminate any such election or appointment. Any such revocation or termination shall be without prejudice to any claim for any damages that such officer may have against the Company or the Company may have against such officer for any breach of any contract of service between him and the Company which may be involved in such revocation or termination.

DIVIDTerminationS Payment of DividTerminations 134. The Directors may from time to time declare dividTerminations to be paid to the Members according to their rights and interests, including such interim dividTerminations as appear to the Directors to be justified by the position of the Company. The Directors may also pay any fixed cash dividTermination which is payable on any Shares of the Company half yearly or on such other dates, whenever the position of the Company, in the opinion of the Directors, justifies such payment. 135. No dividTermination shall be paid otherwise than out of profits or out of monies otherwise available for dividTermination in accordance with the Law. Calculation of DividTerminations 136. Subject to the rights of Members, if any, entitled to Shares with special rights as to dividTerminations, all dividTerminations shall be declared and paid according to the amount paid up on the Shares in respect of which the dividTermination is paid and any dividTermination on any class of Shares not fully paid shall be declared and paid according to the amounts paid on the Shares of that class, but if and so long as nothing is paid up on any of the Shares in the Company, dividTerminations may be declared and paid according to the number of Shares. No amount paid on a Share in advance of calls shall, while carrying interest, be treated for the purposes of this Article as paid on the Share. DividTerminations may be apportioned and paid pro rata according to the amounts paid-up on the Shares during any portion or portions of the period in respect of which the dividTermination is paid. 31 Deductions 137. The Directors may deduct from any dividTermination, distribution or other monies payable to a Member by the Company on or in respect of any Shares all sums of money (if any) presently payable by him to the Company on account of calls or otherwise in respect of Shares of the Company. Joint Holders 138. If several persons are registered as joint holders of any Share, any of them may give effectual receipts for any dividTermination or other money payable on or in respect of the Share. Payment method 139. Any dividTermination may be paid by cheque or warrant sent through the post to the address of the Member or person entitled thereto in the Register of Members or, in the case of joint holders addressed to the holder whose name stands first in the Register of Members in respect of the Shares at his registered address as appearing on the Register of Members or to such person and such address as the Member or person entitled or such joint holders as the case may be may direct in writing. Every such cheque or warrant shall, unless the holder or joint holders may in writing direct, be made payable to the order of the person to whom it is sent or to the order of the holder or, in the case of joint holders, to the order of the holder whose name stands first in the Register of Members in respect of such Shares, and shall be sent at his or their risk and payment of the cheque or warrant by the bank on which it is drawn shall constitute a good discharge to the Company. Any one of two or more joint holders may give effectual receipts for any dividTerminations, distributions or other monies payable or property distributable in respect of the Shares held by such joint holders. Satisfaction by distribution of specific assets 140. The Directors may declare that any dividTermination or distribution is paid wholly or partly by the distribution of specific assets and, in particular, of paid up shares, debentures or debenture stock of any other company or in any one or more of such ways, and where any difficulty arises in regard to such dividTermination or distribution, the Directors may settle the same as they think expedient, and in particular may issue fractional Shares or ignore fractions altogether and may fix the value for dividTermination or distribution of such specific assets or any part thereof and may determine that cash payments shall be made to any Members upon the basis of the value so fixed in order to secure equality of distribution, and may vest any such specific assets in trustees as may seem expedient to the Directors. 32 No interest 141. No dividTermination or other distribution or other monies payable by the Company on or in respect of any Share shall bear interest against the Company. Unclaimed dividTerminations 142. All unclaimed dividTerminations or distributions may be invested or otherwise made use of by the Directors for the benefit of the Company until claimed. Any dividTermination or distribution unclaimed by a Member six years after the dividTermination or distribution payment date shall be forfeited and revert to the Company. RESERVES 143. The Directors may, before declaring any dividTermination or distribution, set aside such sums as they think proper as a reserve or reserves which shall, at the discretion of the Directors, be applicable for meeting contingencies, or for equalising dividTerminations, or for any other purpose of the Company, and pTerminationing such application may, in their discretion, be employed in the business of the Company or be invested in such manner as the Directors may from time to time think fit. The Directors may also without placing the same to reserve carry forward any sums which they think it prudent not to distribute. CAPITALISATION OF PROFITS Capitalisation 144. The Directors may capitalise any sum standing to the credit of any of the Company’s reserve accounts which are available for distribution (including its Share Premium Account and capital redemption reserve fund, subject to the Law) or any sum standing to the credit of the profit and loss account or otherwise available for distribution and to appropriate such sums to Members in the proportions in which such sum would have been divisible amongst them had the same been a distribution of profits by way of dividTermination and to apply such sum on their behalf in paying up in full unissued Shares for allotment and distribution credited as fully paid-up to and amongst them in the proportion aforesaid. Authorisation 145. Where any difficulty arises in regard to any distribution under the last preceding Article, the Directors may settle the same as they think expedient and, in particular, may authorise any person to sell and Assignment any fractions or may resolve that the distribution should be as nearly as may be practicable in the correct proportion but not exactly so or may ignore fractions altogether, and may determine that cash payments should be made to any Members in order to adjust the rights of all parties, as may seem expedient to the Directors. The Directors may appoint any person to sign on behalf of the persons entitled to participate in the distribution any contract necessary or desirable for giving effect thereto and such appointment shall be effective and binding upon the Members. 33 SHARE PREMIUM ACCOUNT 146. The Directors shall in accordance with the Law establish a Share Premium Account and shall carry to the credit of such account from time to time a sum equal to the amount or value of the premium paid on the issue of any Share. 147. There shall be debited to any Share Premium Account on the redemption or purchase of a Share the difference between the nominal value of such Share and the redemption or purchase price provided always that at the discretion of the Directors such sum may be paid out of the profits of the Company or, if permitted by the Law, out of capital.

Inspection by Members 149. The accounting records shall be kept at the Registered Office or at such other place or places as the Directors think fit, and shall at all times be open to inspection by the Directors.

A notice may be given by the Company to the person entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a Member by sTerminationing it through the post in a prepaid letter addressed to them by name, or by the title of representatives of the deceased, or trustee of the bankrupt, or by any like description, at the address, if any, supplied for the purpose by the persons claiming to be so entitled, or (until such an address has been so supplied) by giving the notice in any manner in which the same might have been given if the death or bankruptcy had not occurred. 154.

Subject to the rights attaching to any Shares, if the Company shall be wound up, the liquidator may, with the sanction of a Special Resolution and any other sanction required by the Law or these Articles, divide amongst the Members in kind the whole or any part of the assets of the Company (whether they shall consist of property of the same kind or not) and may for such purpose set such value as he deems fair upon any property to be divided as aforesaid and may determine how such division shall be carried out as between the Members or different classes of Members. The liquidator may, with the like sanction, vest the whole or any part of such assets in trustees upon such trusts for the benefit of the contributories as the liquidator, with the like sanction, shall think fit, but so that no Member shall be compelled to accept any asset upon which there is any liability. Distribution of assets 157. If the Company shall be wound up and the assets available for distribution amongst the Members as such shall be insufficient to repay the whole of the paid up capital, such assets shall be distributed so that, as nearly as may be, the losses shall be borne by the Members in proportion to the capital paid up, or which ought to have been paid up, at the commencement of the winding up, on the Shares held by them respectively. And if in a winding up the assets available for distribution amongst the Members shall be more than sufficient to repay the whole of the capital paid up at the commencement of the winding up, the excess shall be distributed amongst the Members in proportion to the capital paid up at the commencement of the winding up on the Shares held by them respectively. This Article is to be without prejudice to the rights of the holders of Shares issued upon special terms and conditions. Indemnification Indemnification and limitation of liability 158.

Every Indemnified Person shall be indemnified out of the funds of the Company against all liabilities incurred by him by or by reason of any act done, conceived in or omitted in the conduct of the Company’s business or in the discharge of his duties in defTerminationing any proceedings, whether civil or criminal, in which judgment is given in his favour, or in which he is acquitted, or in connection with any application in which relief from liability is granted to him by the court. 161. To the extent that any Indemnified Person is entitled to claim an Indemnification pursuant to these Articles in respect of amounts paid or discharged by him, the relative Indemnification shall take effect as an obligation of the Company to reimburse the person making such payment or effecting such discharge. Wilful neglect or default 162. Each Member and the Company agree to waive any claim or right of action he or it may at any time have, whether individually or by or in the right of the Company, against any Indemnified Person on account of any act or omission of such Indemnified Person in the performance of his duties for the Company; provided however, that such waiver shall not apply to any claims or rights of action arising out of the wilful neglect or default of such Indemnified Person or to recover any gain, personal profit or advantage to which such Indemnified Person is not legally entitled. Advance of legal fees 163. Expenses incurred in defTerminationing any civil or criminal action or proceeding for which indemnification is required pursuant to these Articles shall be paid by the Company in advance of the final disposition of such action or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnified Person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that the Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified pursuant to these Articles. Each Member of the Company shall be deemed to have acknowledged and agreed that the advances of funds may be made by the Company as aforesaid, and when made by the Company under this Article are made to meet expTerminationitures incurred for the purpose of enabling such Indemnified Person to properly perform his or her duties to the Company. 37 CONTINUATION 164.

The Directors may fix in advance a date as the record date to determine the Members entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of the Members and, for the purpose of determining the Members entitled to receive payment of any dividTermination, the Directors may, at or within 90 days prior to the date of the declaration of such dividTermination, fix a subsequent date as the record date for such determination. No fixed record date 11. If no such record date is fixed, the record date shall be the date on which notice of the meeting is sent or the date on which the resolution of the Directors declaring such dividTermination is adopted, as the case may be.

The instrument of Assignment of any Share shall be executed by or on behalf of the Assignmentor (and, if the Directors so determine, the Assignmentee). The Assignmentor shall be deemed to remain the holder of the Share until the name of the Assignmentee is entered in the Register of Members in respect of such Share. All instruments of Assignment, once registered, may be retained by the Company. 17. Subject to any applicable restrictions contained in these Articles, Shares shall be Assignmentred in any usual or common form approved by the Directors. Refusal to register Assignments 18. The Directors may, in their absolute discretion and without assigning any reason therefore, decline to register any Assignment of any Share. The Directors may require reasonable evidence to show the right of the Assignmentor to make the Assignment. 19. If the Directors decline to register a Assignment of Shares they shall sTermination notice of the refusal to the Assignmentee within one month after the date on which the Assignment was lodged with the Company. 20. The Directors may also suspTermination the registration of the Assignments at such times and for such periods as the Directors may from time to time determine. TRANSMISSION OF SHARES Transmission of Shares 21. If a Member dies, the survivor or survivors (where he was a joint holder), and the legal personal representative (where he was sole holder), shall be the only person recognised by the Company as having any title to the Share. The estate of a deceased Member is not thereby released from any liability in respect of any Share held by him, whether solely or jointly. For the purpose of this Article, legal personal representative means the person to whom probate or letters of administration has or have been granted in the Cayman Islands or, if there is no such person, such other person as the Directors may in their absolute discretion determine to be the person recognised by the Company for the purpose of this Article. Election by persons entitled on transmission 22. Any person becoming entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a Member or otherwise by operation of Governing Law may elect, upon such evidence being produced as may be required by the Directors as to his entitlement, either be registered himself as a Member in respect of the Share or, instead of being registered himself, to make such Assignment of the Share as the deceased or bankrupt Member could have made. 7 Manner of election 23. If the person so becoming entitled elects to be registered himself, he shall deliver or sTermination to the Company a notice in writing signed by him stating that he so elects. If he shall elect to Assignment the Shares, he shall signify his election by signing an instrument of Assignment of such Shares in favour of his Assignmentee. All the limitations, restrictions and provisions of these Articles relating to the right to Assignment and the registration of Assignments of Shares shall be applicable to any such notice or instrument of Assignment as aforesaid as if the death of the Member or other event giving rise to the transmission had not occurred and the notice or instrument of Assignment was an instrument of Assignment signed by such Member. Rights of persons entitled on transmission 24. A person becoming entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of the Member (or otherwise by operation of Governing Law), upon such evidence being produced as may be required by the Directors as to his entitlement, shall be entitled to the same dividTerminations and other monies payable in respect of the Share as he would be entitled if he were the holder of such Share. However, he shall not be entitled, until he becomes registered as the holder of such Share, to receive notices of or to attTermination or vote at general meetings of the Company or (except as aforesaid) to exercise any other rights or privileges of a Member. The Directors may at any time give notice requiring such person to elect either to be registered himself or to Assignment the Share and, if the notice is not complied with within sixty days, the Directors may thereafter withhold payment of all dividTerminations and other monies payable in respect of the Shares until the requirements of the notice have been complied with. REDEMPTION AND PURCHASE OF SHARES 25. Subject to the provisions of the Law and the Memorandum, the Company may: 25.1 purchase its own Shares (including any redeemable Shares) in such manner and on such terms as the Directors may agree with the relevant Member unless following such purchase there would no longer be any issued Shares and may make payment for such purchase or for any redemption of Shares in any manner authorised by the Law, including out of capital; and 25.2 reduce its share capital and any capital redemption reserve fund in any manner whatsoever. 8 VARIATION OF SHARE RIGHTS Variation of class rights 26. If at any time the share capital is divided into different classes of Shares, all or any of the special rights attached to any class of Shares (unless otherwise provided by the terms of issue of the Shares of that class) may be varied or abrogated with the consent in writing of the holders of not less than two thirds of the issued Shares of that class or with the sanction of a resolution passed by the holders of not less than two thirds of the issued Shares of that class as may be present in person or by proxy at a separate general meeting of the holders of the Shares of that class. To any such separate general meeting, all of the provisions of these Articles relating to general meetings shall mutatis mutandis apply, but so that the necessary quorum shall be any one or more persons holding or representing by proxy not less than one third of the issued Shares of the class and that any holder of Shares of the relevant class present in person or by proxy may demand a poll. Treatment of classes 27. For the purpose of a separate class meeting, the Directors may treat two or more of all classes of Shares as forming one class if they consider that such class of Shares would be affected in the same way by the proposals under consideration. Effect of Share issue on class rights 28. The rights conferred upon the holders of any Shares shall not, unless otherwise expressly provided in the rights attaching to such Shares, be deemed to be altered by the creation or issue of further Shares ranking pari passu therewith. NON-RECOGNITION OF TRUSTS 29. Except as required by the Law or these Articles, or under an order of a court of competent jurisdiction, the Company shall not be bound by or compelled to recognise in any way, even when notice thereof is given to it, any equitable, contingent, future or partial interest in any Share, or any other rights in respect of any Share other than an absolute right to the entirety thereof in the registered holder. 9 LIEN Lien generally 30. The Company shall have a first and paramount lien on every Share (not being a fully paid Share) for all moneys (whether presently payable or not) called or payable at a date fixed by or in accordance with the terms of issue of such Share in respect of that Share, and the Company shall also have a first and paramount lien on every Share (other than a fully paid up Share) standing registered in the name of a Member, whether singly or jointly with any other person for all debts and liabilities of a Member or his estate to the Company, whether the same shall have been incurred before or after notice to the Company of any interest of any person other than such Member, and whether the time for the payment or discharge of the same shall have actually arrived or not, and notwithstanding that the same are joint debts or liabilities of such Member or his estate and any other person, whether a Member or not. The Directors may at any time, either generally or in any particular case, waive any lien that has arisen or declare any Share to be wholly or in part exempt from the provisions of this Article. The Company's lien, if any, on a Share shall extTermination to all dividTerminations payable thereon. Enforcement 31. The Company may sell, in such manner as the Directors think fit, any Share on which the Company has a lien, provided a sum in respect of which the lien exists is presently payable, and is not paid within fourteen days after a notice in writing has been given to the registered holder  for the time being of the Share, demanding payment of the sum presently payable and giving notice of the intention to sell in default of such payment. Completion of sale 32. For giving effect to any such sale, the Directors may authorise any person to Assignment the Share sold to the purchaser thereof. The purchaser shall be registered as the holder of the Share comprised in any such Assignment and he shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money, nor shall his title to the Share be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings relating to the sale. Application of proceeds 33. The net proceeds of such sale shall be applied in payment or discharge of the debt or liability in respect of which the lien exists and as is presently payable, and any balance shall (subject to a like lien for debts or liabilities not presently payable as existed upon the Shares prior to the sale) be paid to the person who was the registered holder of the Share immediately before such sale. CALLS ON SHARES Calls on Shares generally 34. The Directors may from time to time make calls upon the Members in respect of any moneys unpaid on their Shares (whether in respect of the par value of the Shares or premium or otherwise and not, by the terms of issue thereof, made payable at a future date fixed by or in accordance with such terms of issue); and each Member shall (subject to the Company serving upon him at least 14 days’ notice specifying the time or times and place of payment) pay to the Company at the time or times and place so specified the amount called on his Shares. A call may be revoked or postponed by the Directors wholly or in part as the Directors may determine. A call shall be deemed to have been made at the time when the resolution of the Directors authorising the call was passed. 10 Payment 35. Payment of a call may be made by instalments on the direction of the Directors. 36. If a sum called in respect of a Share is not paid before or on the day appointed for payment thereof, the person from whom the sum is due shall pay interest on the sum from the day payment is due to the time of the actual payment at such rate as the Directors may determine, but the Directors may waive payment of such interest wholly or in part. 37. Any sum payable in respect of a Share on issue or allotment or at any fixed date, whether in respect of the par value of the Share or premium or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a call and if it is not paid all the relevant provisions as to payment of interest, forfeiture or otherwise of these Articles shall apply as if such sum had become due and payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified. 38. The Directors may issue Shares with different terms as to the amount and times of payment of calls. Liability of joint holders 39. The joint holders of a Share shall be jointly and severally liable to pay calls in respect thereof. Interest 40. The Directors may, if they think fit, receive from any Member willing to advance the same, all or any part of the moneys uncalled and unpaid upon any Shares held by him; and may (until the amount would otherwise become payable) pay interest at such rate (not exceeding six per cent without the sanction of the Company in general meeting) as may be agreed upon between the Member paying the sum in advance and the Directors. FORFEITURE OF SHARES Notice 41. If a Member fails to pay any call or instalment of a call by the date it becomes due and payable, the Directors may, at any time thereafter while such call or instalment remains unpaid, give notice to the Member requiring payment of the unpaid portion of the call or instalment, together with any accrued interest and expenses incurred by the Company by reason of such non-payment. 11 42. The notice shall specify where and by what date (not being less than the Termination of 14 days’ from the date of the notice) payment is to be made and shall state that if it is not complied with the Shares in respect of which the call was made will be liable to be forfeited. The Directors may accept the surrTerminationer of any Share liable to be forfeited hereunder and, in such case, references to these Articles to forfeiture shall include surrTerminationer. Forfeiture for non-compliance 43. If such notice is not complied with, any Share in respect of which the notice was given may thereafter, before the payment of all calls or instalments and interest due in respect thereof has been made, be forfeited by a resolution of the Directors. Such forfeiture shall include all dividTerminations declared, other distributions or other monies payable in respect of the forfeited Shares and not paid before the forfeiture. Forfeited Shares 44. A forfeited Share may be sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed of upon such terms and in such manner as the Directors shall think fit, and at any time before a sale, re-allotment or disposition, the forfeiture may be cancelled on such terms as the Directors think fit. Continued liability for forfeited Member 45. A person whose Shares have been forfeited shall cease to be a Member in respect of the forfeited Shares, but shall remain liable to pay to the Company all moneys which at the date of forfeiture were presently payable by him in respect of the Shares together with interest at such rate as the Directors may determine from the date of forfeiture until payment, but his liability shall cease if and when the Company receives payment in full of all amounts due in respect of the Shares. The Company may enforce payment without being under any obligation to make any allowance for the value of the Shares forfeited. Evidence of forfeiture 46. An affidavit in writing by a Director or Secretary of the Company that a Share has been duly forfeited on a specified date, shall be conclusive evidence of the facts stated in it as against all persons claiming to be entitled to the Share. The Company may receive the consideration, if any, given for the Share on any sale, re-allotment or disposition thereof and may authorise some person to execute a Assignment of the Share in favour of the person to whom the Share is sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed of, and he shall thereupon be registered as the holder of the Share, and shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money (if any) nor shall his title to the Share be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings in reference to the forfeiture, sale, re-allotment or disposition of the Share. 12 47. The provisions of these Articles as to forfeiture shall apply in the case of non-payment of any sum which, by the terms of issue of a Share, becomes payable at a fixed time, whether on account of the par value of the Share, or by way of premium or otherwise, as if the same had been made payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified to the Member. INCREASE OF CAPITAL 48. The Company may from time to time by Ordinary Resolution increase its share capital by such sum, to be divided into new Shares of such par value, and with such rights, priorities and privileges attached thereto as the resolution shall prescribe. 49. Subject to any directions given by the Company in a general meeting, all new Shares shall be at the disposal of the Directors in accordance with these Articles. 50. The new Shares shall be subject to the same provisions of these Articles with reference to the payment of calls, lien, forfeiture, Assignment, transmission and otherwise, as the Shares in the original share capital. ALTERATION OF CAPITAL 51. The Company may from time to time by Ordinary Resolution: 51.1 consolidate and divide all or any of its share capital into Shares of larger par value than its existing Shares; 51.2 sub divide its existing Shares, or any of them, into Shares of smaller par value than is fixed by the Memorandum, subject nevertheless to the provisions of section 13 of the Law; 51.3 cancel any Shares which, at the date of the passing of the resolution, have not been taken or agreed to be taken by any person; and 51.4 convert all or any paid up Shares into stock, and reconvert all or any stock into paid up Shares of any denomination. 52. The Company may from time to time by Special Resolution: 52.1 divide its Shares into several classes and attach to such classes any preferential, deferred, or special rights or restrictions in accordance with these Articles; 52.2 change the currency denomination of its share capital; 13 52.3 reduce its share capital and any capital redemption reserve fund in any manner whatsoever; and 52.4 merge or consolidate with any one or more constituent companies (as defined in the Law). GENERAL MEETINGS Convening a meeting 53. The Directors may, whenever they think fit, convene an extraordinary general meeting. If at any time there are not sufficient Directors capable of acting to form a quorum, any Director, or any one or more Members holding in the aggregate not less than one third of the total issued share capital of the Company entitled to vote, may convene an extraordinary general meeting in the same manner as nearly as possible as that in which meetings may be convened by the Directors. Members’ requisition 54. The Directors shall, upon the requisition in writing of one or more Members holding in the aggregate not less than one tenth of such paid up capital of the Company as at the date of the requisition carries the right of voting at general meetings, convene an extraordinary general meeting. Any such requisition shall express the object of the meeting proposed to be called, and must be signed by the requisitionists and deposited at the Registered Office, and may consist of several documents in like form, each signed by one or more requisitionists. 55. If there are no Directors as at the date of the deposit of the Members’ requisition or if the Directors do not convene a general meeting within 21 days from the date of the deposit, the requisitionists or any or any of them or any other Member or Members holding in the aggregate not less than one tenth of such paid up capital of the Company as at the date of the requisition, may convene an extraordinary general meeting. A general meeting convened by requisitionists shall be convened in the same manner as nearly as possible as that in which general meetings are to be convened by the Directors. NOTICE OF GENERAL MEETINGS Length and form of notice 56. At least five clear days’ notice shall be given of any general meeting. Every notice shall specify the place, the day and the time of meeting and, in the case of special business, the general nature of the business to be conducted at the general meeting, and shall be given in the manner provided in these Articles or in such other manner (if any) as may be prescribed by the Company, to such persons as are entitled to receive such notices from the Company. A general meeting may be convened by such shorter notice, or without notice, by a majority in number of the Members having the right to attTermination and vote at the meeting, being a majority together holding not less than ninety-five percent in nominal value of the Shares giving that right. 14 Omission or non-receipt 57. The accidental omission to give notice of a meeting to, or the non-receipt of a notice of a meeting by, any Member entitled to receive notice shall not invalidate the proceedings at any meeting. PROCEEDINGS AT GENERAL MEETINGS 58. All business shall be deemed special that is transacted at an extraordinary general meeting. Quorum 59. No business shall be transacted at any general meeting unless a quorum of Members is present at the time that the meeting proceeds to business, but the absence of a quorum shall not preclude the appointment, choice or election of a chairman, which shall not be treated as part of the business of the Meeting. Save as herein otherwise provided, one or more Members holding in the aggregate not less than one third of the total issued share capital of the Company present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall be a quorum. Adjournment for lack of quorum 60. If within five minutes (or such longer time as the chairman of the meeting may determine to wait) after the time appointed for the meeting, a quorum is not present, the meeting, if convened upon the requisition of Members, shall be dissolved. In any other case, it shall stand adjourned to the same day in the next week, at the same time and place, and if at the adjourned meeting a quorum is not present within half an hour from the time appointed for the meeting, the Members present shall be a quorum. Meeting by telephone or other facilities 61. A meeting of the Members may be held by telephone, electronic or other communication facilities (including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, by telephone or video conferencing) by which all persons participating in the meeting can communicate with each other simultaneously and instantaneously, and participation in such a general meeting shall constitute presence in person at such meeting. 62. Any Director shall be entitled to attTermination and speak at any general meeting of the Company. 15 Appointment of chairman 63. The chairman (if any) of the Board of Directors shall preside as chairman at every general meeting of the Company. If there is no such chairman, or if at any meeting he is not present within five minutes after the time appointed for holding the meeting or is unwilling to act as chairman, the Directors present shall choose one of their number to act or, if only one Director is present, he shall preside as chairman if willing to act. If no Director is present, or if each of the Directors present declines to take the chair, the Members present and entitled to vote shall elect one of their number to be chairman. Adjournment of meeting 64. The chairman may, with the consent of a meeting at which a quorum is present (and shall if so directed by the meeting) adjourn the meeting from time to time and from place to place, but no business shall be transacted at any adjourned meeting other than the business left unfinished at the meeting from which the adjournment took place. When a meeting is adjourned for ten days or more, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given as in the case of an original meeting. Save as aforesaid, it shall not be necessary to give any notice of an adjournment or of the business to be transacted at an adjourned meeting. VOTING Ordinary Resolution Save where a Special Resolution or other greater majority is required by the Law or these Articles, any question proposed for consideration at any general meeting shall be decided by an Ordinary Resolution. Voting on a show of hands 65. At any general meeting, a resolution put to the vote of the meeting shall be decided on a show of hands, unless before or on the declaration of the result of the show of hands, or on the withdrawal of any other demand for a poll. Demand for poll 66. A poll is demanded by: 66.1 the chairman of the meeting; or 66.2 at least three Members present in person or by proxy; or 66.3 any Member or Members present in person or by proxy and holding collectively not less than one tenth of the total voting rights of all the Members having the right to vote at such meeting; or 16 66.4 a Member or Members present in person or by proxy holding Shares conferring the right to vote at such meeting, being Shares on which an aggregate sum has been paid up equal to not less than one tenth of the total sum paid up on all such Shares conferring such right. 67. Unless a poll is duly demanded and the demand is not withdrawn, a declaration by the chairman that a resolution has, on a show of hands, been carried or carried unanimously, or by a particular majority, or lost and an entry to that effect in the minutes of the proceedings of the Company shall be conclusive evidence of that fact, without proof of the number or proportion of the votes recorded in favour of, or against, that resolution. The demand for a poll may be withdrawn by the person or any persons making it at any time prior to the declaration of the result of the poll. 68. If a poll is duly demanded, it shall be taken in such manner as the chairman directs, and the result of the poll shall be deemed to be the resolution of the meeting at which the poll was demanded. 69. In the case of an equality of votes at a general meeting, whether on a show of hands or on a poll, the chairman of the meeting at which the show of hands takes place or at which the poll is demanded, shall not be entitled to a second or casting vote and the resolution shall fail. 70. A poll demanded on the election of a chairman or on a question of adjournment shall be taken forthwith. A poll demanded on any other question shall be taken in such manner and either forthwith or at such time later in the meeting as the chairman of the meeting shall direct. 71. The demand for a poll shall not prevent the continuance of a meeting for the transaction of any business other than the question on which the poll has been demanded and it may be withdrawn at any time before the close of the meeting or the taking of the poll, whichever is the earlier. Voting on a poll 72. On a poll votes may be cast either personally or by proxy. 73. A person entitled to more than one vote on a poll need not use all his votes or cast all the votes he uses in the same way. 74. On a show of hands, every Member present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall have one vote. On a poll, every Member present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall have one vote for each Share of which he is the registered holder. 17 75. In the case of joint holders of a Share, the vote of the senior who tTerminationers a vote, whether in person or by proxy, shall be accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint holders; and for this purpose seniority shall be determined by the order in which the names stand in the Register of Members in respect of the joint holding. 76. A Member of unsound mind, or, in respect of whom an order has been made by any court having jurisdiction in lunacy, may vote, whether on a show of hands or on a poll, by his receiver, committee, curator bonis or other person of similar nature appointed by such court, and any such receiver, committee, curator bonis or other person may vote by proxy and may otherwise act and be treated as such Member for the purpose of the general meetings. 77. No Member, unless the Directors otherwise determine, shall be entitled to vote at any general meeting, unless all calls or other sums presently payable by him in respect of Shares in the Company have been paid. 78. No objection shall be raised as to the qualification of any voter or as to whether any votes have been properly counted except at the general meeting or adjourned general meeting at which the vote objected to is given or tTerminationered and every vote not disallowed at the meeting shall be valid. Any objection made in due time and in accordance with these Articles shall be referred to the chairman whose decision shall be final and conclusive. Shareholder Restricted Matters 78A.

Such Secretary or other officers need not be Directors and in the case of the other officers may be ascribed such titles as the Directors may decide and the Directors may revoke or terminate any such election or appointment. Any such revocation or termination shall be without prejudice to any claim for any damages that such officer may have against the Company or the Company may have against such officer for any breach of any contract of service between him and the Company which may be involved in such revocation or termination.

DIVIDTerminationS Payment of DividTerminations 134. The Directors may from time to time declare dividTerminations to be paid to the Members according to their rights and interests, including such interim dividTerminations as appear to the Directors to be justified by the position of the Company. The Directors may also pay any fixed cash dividTermination which is payable on any Shares of the Company half yearly or on such other dates, whenever the position of the Company, in the opinion of the Directors, justifies such payment. 135. No dividTermination shall be paid otherwise than out of profits or out of monies otherwise available for dividTermination in accordance with the Law. Calculation of DividTerminations 136. Subject to the rights of Members, if any, entitled to Shares with special rights as to dividTerminations, all dividTerminations shall be declared and paid according to the amount paid up on the Shares in respect of which the dividTermination is paid and any dividTermination on any class of Shares not fully paid shall be declared and paid according to the amounts paid on the Shares of that class, but if and so long as nothing is paid up on any of the Shares in the Company, dividTerminations may be declared and paid according to the number of Shares. No amount paid on a Share in advance of calls shall, while carrying interest, be treated for the purposes of this Article as paid on the Share. DividTerminations may be apportioned and paid pro rata according to the amounts paid-up on the Shares during any portion or portions of the period in respect of which the dividTermination is paid. 31 Deductions 137. The Directors may deduct from any dividTermination, distribution or other monies payable to a Member by the Company on or in respect of any Shares all sums of money (if any) presently payable by him to the Company on account of calls or otherwise in respect of Shares of the Company. Joint Holders 138. If several persons are registered as joint holders of any Share, any of them may give effectual receipts for any dividTermination or other money payable on or in respect of the Share. Payment method 139. Any dividTermination may be paid by cheque or warrant sent through the post to the address of the Member or person entitled thereto in the Register of Members or, in the case of joint holders addressed to the holder whose name stands first in the Register of Members in respect of the Shares at his registered address as appearing on the Register of Members or to such person and such address as the Member or person entitled or such joint holders as the case may be may direct in writing. Every such cheque or warrant shall, unless the holder or joint holders may in writing direct, be made payable to the order of the person to whom it is sent or to the order of the holder or, in the case of joint holders, to the order of the holder whose name stands first in the Register of Members in respect of such Shares, and shall be sent at his or their risk and payment of the cheque or warrant by the bank on which it is drawn shall constitute a good discharge to the Company. Any one of two or more joint holders may give effectual receipts for any dividTerminations, distributions or other monies payable or property distributable in respect of the Shares held by such joint holders. Satisfaction by distribution of specific assets 140. The Directors may declare that any dividTermination or distribution is paid wholly or partly by the distribution of specific assets and, in particular, of paid up shares, debentures or debenture stock of any other company or in any one or more of such ways, and where any difficulty arises in regard to such dividTermination or distribution, the Directors may settle the same as they think expedient, and in particular may issue fractional Shares or ignore fractions altogether and may fix the value for dividTermination or distribution of such specific assets or any part thereof and may determine that cash payments shall be made to any Members upon the basis of the value so fixed in order to secure equality of distribution, and may vest any such specific assets in trustees as may seem expedient to the Directors. 32 No interest 141. No dividTermination or other distribution or other monies payable by the Company on or in respect of any Share shall bear interest against the Company. Unclaimed dividTerminations 142. All unclaimed dividTerminations or distributions may be invested or otherwise made use of by the Directors for the benefit of the Company until claimed. Any dividTermination or distribution unclaimed by a Member six years after the dividTermination or distribution payment date shall be forfeited and revert to the Company. RESERVES 143. The Directors may, before declaring any dividTermination or distribution, set aside such sums as they think proper as a reserve or reserves which shall, at the discretion of the Directors, be applicable for meeting contingencies, or for equalising dividTerminations, or for any other purpose of the Company, and pTerminationing such application may, in their discretion, be employed in the business of the Company or be invested in such manner as the Directors may from time to time think fit. The Directors may also without placing the same to reserve carry forward any sums which they think it prudent not to distribute. CAPITALISATION OF PROFITS Capitalisation 144. The Directors may capitalise any sum standing to the credit of any of the Company’s reserve accounts which are available for distribution (including its Share Premium Account and capital redemption reserve fund, subject to the Law) or any sum standing to the credit of the profit and loss account or otherwise available for distribution and to appropriate such sums to Members in the proportions in which such sum would have been divisible amongst them had the same been a distribution of profits by way of dividTermination and to apply such sum on their behalf in paying up in full unissued Shares for allotment and distribution credited as fully paid-up to and amongst them in the proportion aforesaid. Authorisation 145. Where any difficulty arises in regard to any distribution under the last preceding Article, the Directors may settle the same as they think expedient and, in particular, may authorise any person to sell and Assignment any fractions or may resolve that the distribution should be as nearly as may be practicable in the correct proportion but not exactly so or may ignore fractions altogether, and may determine that cash payments should be made to any Members in order to adjust the rights of all parties, as may seem expedient to the Directors. The Directors may appoint any person to sign on behalf of the persons entitled to participate in the distribution any contract necessary or desirable for giving effect thereto and such appointment shall be effective and binding upon the Members. 33 SHARE PREMIUM ACCOUNT 146. The Directors shall in accordance with the Law establish a Share Premium Account and shall carry to the credit of such account from time to time a sum equal to the amount or value of the premium paid on the issue of any Share. 147. There shall be debited to any Share Premium Account on the redemption or purchase of a Share the difference between the nominal value of such Share and the redemption or purchase price provided always that at the discretion of the Directors such sum may be paid out of the profits of the Company or, if permitted by the Law, out of capital.

Inspection by Members 149. The accounting records shall be kept at the Registered Office or at such other place or places as the Directors think fit, and shall at all times be open to inspection by the Directors.

A notice may be given by the Company to the person entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a Member by sTerminationing it through the post in a prepaid letter addressed to them by name, or by the title of representatives of the deceased, or trustee of the bankrupt, or by any like description, at the address, if any, supplied for the purpose by the persons claiming to be so entitled, or (until such an address has been so supplied) by giving the notice in any manner in which the same might have been given if the death or bankruptcy had not occurred. 154.

Subject to the rights attaching to any Shares, if the Company shall be wound up, the liquidator may, with the sanction of a Special Resolution and any other sanction required by the Law or these Articles, divide amongst the Members in kind the whole or any part of the assets of the Company (whether they shall consist of property of the same kind or not) and may for such purpose set such value as he deems fair upon any property to be divided as aforesaid and may determine how such division shall be carried out as between the Members or different classes of Members. The liquidator may, with the like sanction, vest the whole or any part of such assets in trustees upon such trusts for the benefit of the contributories as the liquidator, with the like sanction, shall think fit, but so that no Member shall be compelled to accept any asset upon which there is any liability. Distribution of assets 157. If the Company shall be wound up and the assets available for distribution amongst the Members as such shall be insufficient to repay the whole of the paid up capital, such assets shall be distributed so that, as nearly as may be, the losses shall be borne by the Members in proportion to the capital paid up, or which ought to have been paid up, at the commencement of the winding up, on the Shares held by them respectively. And if in a winding up the assets available for distribution amongst the Members shall be more than sufficient to repay the whole of the capital paid up at the commencement of the winding up, the excess shall be distributed amongst the Members in proportion to the capital paid up at the commencement of the winding up on the Shares held by them respectively. This Article is to be without prejudice to the rights of the holders of Shares issued upon special terms and conditions. Indemnification Indemnification and limitation of liability 158.

Every Indemnified Person shall be indemnified out of the funds of the Company against all liabilities incurred by him by or by reason of any act done, conceived in or omitted in the conduct of the Company’s business or in the discharge of his duties in defTerminationing any proceedings, whether civil or criminal, in which judgment is given in his favour, or in which he is acquitted, or in connection with any application in which relief from liability is granted to him by the court. 161. To the extent that any Indemnified Person is entitled to claim an Indemnification pursuant to these Articles in respect of amounts paid or discharged by him, the relative Indemnification shall take effect as an obligation of the Company to reimburse the person making such payment or effecting such discharge. Wilful neglect or default 162. Each Member and the Company agree to waive any claim or right of action he or it may at any time have, whether individually or by or in the right of the Company, against any Indemnified Person on account of any act or omission of such Indemnified Person in the performance of his duties for the Company; provided however, that such waiver shall not apply to any claims or rights of action arising out of the wilful neglect or default of such Indemnified Person or to recover any gain, personal profit or advantage to which such Indemnified Person is not legally entitled. Advance of legal fees 163. Expenses incurred in defTerminationing any civil or criminal action or proceeding for which indemnification is required pursuant to these Articles shall be paid by the Company in advance of the final disposition of such action or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnified Person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that the Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified pursuant to these Articles. Each Member of the Company shall be deemed to have acknowledged and agreed that the advances of funds may be made by the Company as aforesaid, and when made by the Company under this Article are made to meet expTerminationitures incurred for the purpose of enabling such Indemnified Person to properly perform his or her duties to the Company. 37 CONTINUATION 164.

The Directors may (subject to the provisions of these Articles and the Law), without prejudice to any rights attached to any existing Shares, offer, allot, grant options over or otherwise dispose of the Shares with or without preferred, deferred, qualified or other special rights or restrictions, whether in regard to dividTerminations or other forms of distribution, voting, return of capital or otherwise, and to such persons and on such terms and conditions and for such consideration, and at such times as they think fit, provided no Share shall be issued at a discount (except in accordance with the provisions of the Law). Any Share may, with the sanction of a Special Resolution, be issued on the terms that it is, or at the option of the Company or the holder is liable, to be redeemed. Power for Subscriber to issue and Assignment Shares 6. Notwithstanding the preceding Article, the Subscriber shall have the power to: 6.1 issue one Share to itself; 6.2 Assignment that Share by an instrument of Assignment to any person; and 6.3 update the Register of Members in respect of the issue and Assignment of that Share. No Shares to bearer 7. The Company shall not issue Shares to bearer. Fractional Shares 8. The Company may, in accordance with the Law, issue fractions of Shares. REGISTER OF MEMBERS 9. The Directors shall establish and maintain (or cause to be established and maintained) the Register of Members at the Registered Office or at such other place determined by the Directors in the manner prescribed by the Law. 5 RECORD DATE Power of Directors to fix record date 10. The Directors may fix in advance a date as the record date to determine the Members entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of the Members and, for the purpose of determining the Members entitled to receive payment of any dividTermination, the Directors may, at or within 90 days prior to the date of the declaration of such dividTermination, fix a subsequent date as the record date for such determination. No fixed record date 11. If no such record date is fixed, the record date shall be the date on which notice of the meeting is sent or the date on which the resolution of the Directors declaring such dividTermination is adopted, as the case may be. A determination of Members entitled to vote at any meeting of Members in accordance with this Article, shall apply to any adjournment thereof. SHARE CERTIFICATES Issue of Share Certificates 12. Every Member shall be entitled, without payment, to a certificate of the Company specifying the Share or Shares held by him and the amount paid up thereon. 13. Notwithstanding the provisions of these Articles, the Directors may resolve not to issue share certificates to Members of the Company. Certificates for jointly-held Shares 14. The Company shall not be bound to issue more than one certificate for Shares held jointly by more than one person, and delivery of a certificate to one joint holder shall be sufficient delivery to all. Replacement Share Certificates 15. If a share certificate is defaced, lost or destroyed, it may be replaced on payment of such fee (if any) and on such terms (if any) as to evidence and Indemnification, and on the payment of expenses of the Company in investigating such evidence and preparing such Indemnification as the Directors shall think fit and, in case of defacement, on delivery of the old certificate to the Company for cancellation. 6 Assignment OF SHARES Instrument of Assignment 16. The instrument of Assignment of any Share shall be executed by or on behalf of the Assignmentor (and, if the Directors so determine, the Assignmentee). The Assignmentor shall be deemed to remain the holder of the Share until the name of the Assignmentee is entered in the Register of Members in respect of such Share. All instruments of Assignment, once registered, may be retained by the Company. 17. Subject to any applicable restrictions contained in these Articles, Shares shall be Assignmentred in any usual or common form approved by the Directors. Refusal to register Assignments 18. The Directors may, in their absolute discretion and without assigning any reason therefore, decline to register any Assignment of any Share. The Directors may require reasonable evidence to show the right of the Assignmentor to make the Assignment. 19. If the Directors decline to register a Assignment of Shares they shall sTermination notice of the refusal to the Assignmentee within one month after the date on which the Assignment was lodged with the Company. 20. The Directors may also suspTermination the registration of the Assignments at such times and for such periods as the Directors may from time to time determine. TRANSMISSION OF SHARES Transmission of Shares 21. If a Member dies, the survivor or survivors (where he was a joint holder), and the legal personal representative (where he was sole holder), shall be the only person recognised by the Company as having any title to the Share. The estate of a deceased Member is not thereby released from any liability in respect of any Share held by him, whether solely or jointly. For the purpose of this Article, legal personal representative means the person to whom probate or letters of administration has or have been granted in the Cayman Islands or, if there is no such person, such other person as the Directors may in their absolute discretion determine to be the person recognised by the Company for the purpose of this Article. Election by persons entitled on transmission 22. Any person becoming entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a Member or otherwise by operation of Governing Law may elect, upon such evidence being produced as may be required by the Directors as to his entitlement, either be registered himself as a Member in respect of the Share or, instead of being registered himself, to make such Assignment of the Share as the deceased or bankrupt Member could have made. 7 Manner of election 23. If the person so becoming entitled elects to be registered himself, he shall deliver or sTermination to the Company a notice in writing signed by him stating that he so elects. If he shall elect to Assignment the Shares, he shall signify his election by signing an instrument of Assignment of such Shares in favour of his Assignmentee. All the limitations, restrictions and provisions of these Articles relating to the right to Assignment and the registration of Assignments of Shares shall be applicable to any such notice or instrument of Assignment as aforesaid as if the death of the Member or other event giving rise to the transmission had not occurred and the notice or instrument of Assignment was an instrument of Assignment signed by such Member. Rights of persons entitled on transmission 24. A person becoming entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of the Member (or otherwise by operation of Governing Law), upon such evidence being produced as may be required by the Directors as to his entitlement, shall be entitled to the same dividTerminations and other monies payable in respect of the Share as he would be entitled if he were the holder of such Share. However, he shall not be entitled, until he becomes registered as the holder of such Share, to receive notices of or to attTermination or vote at general meetings of the Company or (except as aforesaid) to exercise any other rights or privileges of a Member. The Directors may at any time give notice requiring such person to elect either to be registered himself or to Assignment the Share and, if the notice is not complied with within sixty days, the Directors may thereafter withhold payment of all dividTerminations and other monies payable in respect of the Shares until the requirements of the notice have been complied with. REDEMPTION AND PURCHASE OF SHARES 25. Subject to the provisions of the Law and the Memorandum, the Company may: 25.1 purchase its own Shares (including any redeemable Shares) in such manner and on such terms as the Directors may agree with the relevant Member unless following such purchase there would no longer be any issued Shares and may make payment for such purchase or for any redemption of Shares in any manner authorised by the Law, including out of capital; and 25.2 reduce its share capital and any capital redemption reserve fund in any manner whatsoever. 8 VARIATION OF SHARE RIGHTS Variation of class rights 26. If at any time the share capital is divided into different classes of Shares, all or any of the special rights attached to any class of Shares (unless otherwise provided by the terms of issue of the Shares of that class) may be varied or abrogated with the consent in writing of the holders of not less than two thirds of the issued Shares of that class or with the sanction of a resolution passed by the holders of not less than two thirds of the issued Shares of that class as may be present in person or by proxy at a separate general meeting of the holders of the Shares of that class. To any such separate general meeting, all of the provisions of these Articles relating to general meetings shall mutatis mutandis apply, but so that the necessary quorum shall be any one or more persons holding or representing by proxy not less than one third of the issued Shares of the class and that any holder of Shares of the relevant class present in person or by proxy may demand a poll. Treatment of classes 27. For the purpose of a separate class meeting, the Directors may treat two or more of all classes of Shares as forming one class if they consider that such class of Shares would be affected in the same way by the proposals under consideration. Effect of Share issue on class rights 28. The rights conferred upon the holders of any Shares shall not, unless otherwise expressly provided in the rights attaching to such Shares, be deemed to be altered by the creation or issue of further Shares ranking pari passu therewith. NON-RECOGNITION OF TRUSTS 29. Except as required by the Law or these Articles, or under an order of a court of competent jurisdiction, the Company shall not be bound by or compelled to recognise in any way, even when notice thereof is given to it, any equitable, contingent, future or partial interest in any Share, or any other rights in respect of any Share other than an absolute right to the entirety thereof in the registered holder. 9 LIEN Lien generally 30. The Company shall have a first and paramount lien on every Share (not being a fully paid Share) for all moneys (whether presently payable or not) called or payable at a date fixed by or in accordance with the terms of issue of such Share in respect of that Share, and the Company shall also have a first and paramount lien on every Share (other than a fully paid up Share) standing registered in the name of a Member, whether singly or jointly with any other person for all debts and liabilities of a Member or his estate to the Company, whether the same shall have been incurred before or after notice to the Company of any interest of any person other than such Member, and whether the time for the payment or discharge of the same shall have actually arrived or not, and notwithstanding that the same are joint debts or liabilities of such Member or his estate and any other person, whether a Member or not. The Directors may at any time, either generally or in any particular case, waive any lien that has arisen or declare any Share to be wholly or in part exempt from the provisions of this Article. The Company's lien, if any, on a Share shall extTermination to all dividTerminations payable thereon. Enforcement 31. The Company may sell, in such manner as the Directors think fit, any Share on which the Company has a lien, provided a sum in respect of which the lien exists is presently payable, and is not paid within fourteen days after a notice in writing has been given to the registered holder  for the time being of the Share, demanding payment of the sum presently payable and giving notice of the intention to sell in default of such payment. Completion of sale 32. For giving effect to any such sale, the Directors may authorise any person to Assignment the Share sold to the purchaser thereof. The purchaser shall be registered as the holder of the Share comprised in any such Assignment and he shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money, nor shall his title to the Share be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings relating to the sale. Application of proceeds 33. The net proceeds of such sale shall be applied in payment or discharge of the debt or liability in respect of which the lien exists and as is presently payable, and any balance shall (subject to a like lien for debts or liabilities not presently payable as existed upon the Shares prior to the sale) be paid to the person who was the registered holder of the Share immediately before such sale. CALLS ON SHARES Calls on Shares generally 34. The Directors may from time to time make calls upon the Members in respect of any moneys unpaid on their Shares (whether in respect of the par value of the Shares or premium or otherwise and not, by the terms of issue thereof, made payable at a future date fixed by or in accordance with such terms of issue); and each Member shall (subject to the Company serving upon him at least 14 days’ notice specifying the time or times and place of payment) pay to the Company at the time or times and place so specified the amount called on his Shares. A call may be revoked or postponed by the Directors wholly or in part as the Directors may determine. A call shall be deemed to have been made at the time when the resolution of the Directors authorising the call was passed. 10 Payment 35. Payment of a call may be made by instalments on the direction of the Directors. 36. If a sum called in respect of a Share is not paid before or on the day appointed for payment thereof, the person from whom the sum is due shall pay interest on the sum from the day payment is due to the time of the actual payment at such rate as the Directors may determine, but the Directors may waive payment of such interest wholly or in part. 37. Any sum payable in respect of a Share on issue or allotment or at any fixed date, whether in respect of the par value of the Share or premium or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a call and if it is not paid all the relevant provisions as to payment of interest, forfeiture or otherwise of these Articles shall apply as if such sum had become due and payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified. 38. The Directors may issue Shares with different terms as to the amount and times of payment of calls. Liability of joint holders 39. The joint holders of a Share shall be jointly and severally liable to pay calls in respect thereof. Interest 40. The Directors may, if they think fit, receive from any Member willing to advance the same, all or any part of the moneys uncalled and unpaid upon any Shares held by him; and may (until the amount would otherwise become payable) pay interest at such rate (not exceeding six per cent without the sanction of the Company in general meeting) as may be agreed upon between the Member paying the sum in advance and the Directors. FORFEITURE OF SHARES Notice 41. If a Member fails to pay any call or instalment of a call by the date it becomes due and payable, the Directors may, at any time thereafter while such call or instalment remains unpaid, give notice to the Member requiring payment of the unpaid portion of the call or instalment, together with any accrued interest and expenses incurred by the Company by reason of such non-payment. 11 42. The notice shall specify where and by what date (not being less than the Termination of 14 days’ from the date of the notice) payment is to be made and shall state that if it is not complied with the Shares in respect of which the call was made will be liable to be forfeited. The Directors may accept the surrTerminationer of any Share liable to be forfeited hereunder and, in such case, references to these Articles to forfeiture shall include surrTerminationer. Forfeiture for non-compliance 43. If such notice is not complied with, any Share in respect of which the notice was given may thereafter, before the payment of all calls or instalments and interest due in respect thereof has been made, be forfeited by a resolution of the Directors. Such forfeiture shall include all dividTerminations declared, other distributions or other monies payable in respect of the forfeited Shares and not paid before the forfeiture. Forfeited Shares 44. A forfeited Share may be sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed of upon such terms and in such manner as the Directors shall think fit, and at any time before a sale, re-allotment or disposition, the forfeiture may be cancelled on such terms as the Directors think fit. Continued liability for forfeited Member 45. A person whose Shares have been forfeited shall cease to be a Member in respect of the forfeited Shares, but shall remain liable to pay to the Company all moneys which at the date of forfeiture were presently payable by him in respect of the Shares together with interest at such rate as the Directors may determine from the date of forfeiture until payment, but his liability shall cease if and when the Company receives payment in full of all amounts due in respect of the Shares. The Company may enforce payment without being under any obligation to make any allowance for the value of the Shares forfeited. Evidence of forfeiture 46. An affidavit in writing by a Director or Secretary of the Company that a Share has been duly forfeited on a specified date, shall be conclusive evidence of the facts stated in it as against all persons claiming to be entitled to the Share. The Company may receive the consideration, if any, given for the Share on any sale, re-allotment or disposition thereof and may authorise some person to execute a Assignment of the Share in favour of the person to whom the Share is sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed of, and he shall thereupon be registered as the holder of the Share, and shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money (if any) nor shall his title to the Share be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings in reference to the forfeiture, sale, re-allotment or disposition of the Share. 12 47. The provisions of these Articles as to forfeiture shall apply in the case of non-payment of any sum which, by the terms of issue of a Share, becomes payable at a fixed time, whether on account of the par value of the Share, or by way of premium or otherwise, as if the same had been made payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified to the Member. INCREASE OF CAPITAL 48. The Company may from time to time by Ordinary Resolution increase its share capital by such sum, to be divided into new Shares of such par value, and with such rights, priorities and privileges attached thereto as the resolution shall prescribe. 49. Subject to any directions given by the Company in a general meeting, all new Shares shall be at the disposal of the Directors in accordance with these Articles. 50. The new Shares shall be subject to the same provisions of these Articles with reference to the payment of calls, lien, forfeiture, Assignment, transmission and otherwise, as the Shares in the original share capital. ALTERATION OF CAPITAL 51. The Company may from time to time by Ordinary Resolution: 51.1 consolidate and divide all or any of its share capital into Shares of larger par value than its existing Shares; 51.2 sub divide its existing Shares, or any of them, into Shares of smaller par value than is fixed by the Memorandum, subject nevertheless to the provisions of section 13 of the Law; 51.3 cancel any Shares which, at the date of the passing of the resolution, have not been taken or agreed to be taken by any person; and 51.4 convert all or any paid up Shares into stock, and reconvert all or any stock into paid up Shares of any denomination. 52. The Company may from time to time by Special Resolution: 52.1 divide its Shares into several classes and attach to such classes any preferential, deferred, or special rights or restrictions in accordance with these Articles; 52.2 change the currency denomination of its share capital; 13 52.3 reduce its share capital and any capital redemption reserve fund in any manner whatsoever; and 52.4 merge or consolidate with any one or more constituent companies (as defined in the Law). GENERAL MEETINGS Convening a meeting 53. The Directors may, whenever they think fit, convene an extraordinary general meeting. If at any time there are not sufficient Directors capable of acting to form a quorum, any Director, or any one or more Members holding in the aggregate not less than one third of the total issued share capital of the Company entitled to vote, may convene an extraordinary general meeting in the same manner as nearly as possible as that in which meetings may be convened by the Directors. Members’ requisition 54. The Directors shall, upon the requisition in writing of one or more Members holding in the aggregate not less than one tenth of such paid up capital of the Company as at the date of the requisition carries the right of voting at general meetings, convene an extraordinary general meeting. Any such requisition shall express the object of the meeting proposed to be called, and must be signed by the requisitionists and deposited at the Registered Office, and may consist of several documents in like form, each signed by one or more requisitionists. 55. If there are no Directors as at the date of the deposit of the Members’ requisition or if the Directors do not convene a general meeting within 21 days from the date of the deposit, the requisitionists or any or any of them or any other Member or Members holding in the aggregate not less than one tenth of such paid up capital of the Company as at the date of the requisition, may convene an extraordinary general meeting. A general meeting convened by requisitionists shall be convened in the same manner as nearly as possible as that in which general meetings are to be convened by the Directors. NOTICE OF GENERAL MEETINGS Length and form of notice 56. At least five clear days’ notice shall be given of any general meeting. Every notice shall specify the place, the day and the time of meeting and, in the case of special business, the general nature of the business to be conducted at the general meeting, and shall be given in the manner provided in these Articles or in such other manner (if any) as may be prescribed by the Company, to such persons as are entitled to receive such notices from the Company. A general meeting may be convened by such shorter notice, or without notice, by a majority in number of the Members having the right to attTermination and vote at the meeting, being a majority together holding not less than ninety-five percent in nominal value of the Shares giving that right. 14 Omission or non-receipt 57. The accidental omission to give notice of a meeting to, or the non-receipt of a notice of a meeting by, any Member entitled to receive notice shall not invalidate the proceedings at any meeting. PROCEEDINGS AT GENERAL MEETINGS 58. All business shall be deemed special that is transacted at an extraordinary general meeting. Quorum 59. No business shall be transacted at any general meeting unless a quorum of Members is present at the time that the meeting proceeds to business, but the absence of a quorum shall not preclude the appointment, choice or election of a chairman, which shall not be treated as part of the business of the Meeting. Save as herein otherwise provided, one or more Members holding in the aggregate not less than one third of the total issued share capital of the Company present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall be a quorum. Adjournment for lack of quorum 60. If within five minutes (or such longer time as the chairman of the meeting may determine to wait) after the time appointed for the meeting, a quorum is not present, the meeting, if convened upon the requisition of Members, shall be dissolved. In any other case, it shall stand adjourned to the same day in the next week, at the same time and place, and if at the adjourned meeting a quorum is not present within half an hour from the time appointed for the meeting, the Members present shall be a quorum. Meeting by telephone or other facilities 61. A meeting of the Members may be held by telephone, electronic or other communication facilities (including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, by telephone or video conferencing) by which all persons participating in the meeting can communicate with each other simultaneously and instantaneously, and participation in such a general meeting shall constitute presence in person at such meeting. 62. Any Director shall be entitled to attTermination and speak at any general meeting of the Company. 15 Appointment of chairman 63. The chairman (if any) of the Board of Directors shall preside as chairman at every general meeting of the Company. If there is no such chairman, or if at any meeting he is not present within five minutes after the time appointed for holding the meeting or is unwilling to act as chairman, the Directors present shall choose one of their number to act or, if only one Director is present, he shall preside as chairman if willing to act. If no Director is present, or if each of the Directors present declines to take the chair, the Members present and entitled to vote shall elect one of their number to be chairman. Adjournment of meeting 64. The chairman may, with the consent of a meeting at which a quorum is present (and shall if so directed by the meeting) adjourn the meeting from time to time and from place to place, but no business shall be transacted at any adjourned meeting other than the business left unfinished at the meeting from which the adjournment took place. When a meeting is adjourned for ten days or more, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given as in the case of an original meeting. Save as aforesaid, it shall not be necessary to give any notice of an adjournment or of the business to be transacted at an adjourned meeting. VOTING Ordinary Resolution Save where a Special Resolution or other greater majority is required by the Law or these Articles, any question proposed for consideration at any general meeting shall be decided by an Ordinary Resolution. Voting on a show of hands 65. At any general meeting, a resolution put to the vote of the meeting shall be decided on a show of hands, unless before or on the declaration of the result of the show of hands, or on the withdrawal of any other demand for a poll. Demand for poll 66. A poll is demanded by: 66.1 the chairman of the meeting; or 66.2 at least three Members present in person or by proxy; or 66.3 any Member or Members present in person or by proxy and holding collectively not less than one tenth of the total voting rights of all the Members having the right to vote at such meeting; or 16 66.4 a Member or Members present in person or by proxy holding Shares conferring the right to vote at such meeting, being Shares on which an aggregate sum has been paid up equal to not less than one tenth of the total sum paid up on all such Shares conferring such right. 67. Unless a poll is duly demanded and the demand is not withdrawn, a declaration by the chairman that a resolution has, on a show of hands, been carried or carried unanimously, or by a particular majority, or lost and an entry to that effect in the minutes of the proceedings of the Company shall be conclusive evidence of that fact, without proof of the number or proportion of the votes recorded in favour of, or against, that resolution. The demand for a poll may be withdrawn by the person or any persons making it at any time prior to the declaration of the result of the poll. 68. If a poll is duly demanded, it shall be taken in such manner as the chairman directs, and the result of the poll shall be deemed to be the resolution of the meeting at which the poll was demanded. 69. In the case of an equality of votes at a general meeting, whether on a show of hands or on a poll, the chairman of the meeting at which the show of hands takes place or at which the poll is demanded, shall not be entitled to a second or casting vote and the resolution shall fail. 70. A poll demanded on the election of a chairman or on a question of adjournment shall be taken forthwith. A poll demanded on any other question shall be taken in such manner and either forthwith or at such time later in the meeting as the chairman of the meeting shall direct. 71. The demand for a poll shall not prevent the continuance of a meeting for the transaction of any business other than the question on which the poll has been demanded and it may be withdrawn at any time before the close of the meeting or the taking of the poll, whichever is the earlier. Voting on a poll 72. On a poll votes may be cast either personally or by proxy. 73. A person entitled to more than one vote on a poll need not use all his votes or cast all the votes he uses in the same way. 74. On a show of hands, every Member present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall have one vote. On a poll, every Member present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall have one vote for each Share of which he is the registered holder. 17 75. In the case of joint holders of a Share, the vote of the senior who tTerminationers a vote, whether in person or by proxy, shall be accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint holders; and for this purpose seniority shall be determined by the order in which the names stand in the Register of Members in respect of the joint holding. 76. A Member of unsound mind, or, in respect of whom an order has been made by any court having jurisdiction in lunacy, may vote, whether on a show of hands or on a poll, by his receiver, committee, curator bonis or other person of similar nature appointed by such court, and any such receiver, committee, curator bonis or other person may vote by proxy and may otherwise act and be treated as such Member for the purpose of the general meetings. 77. No Member, unless the Directors otherwise determine, shall be entitled to vote at any general meeting, unless all calls or other sums presently payable by him in respect of Shares in the Company have been paid. 78. No objection shall be raised as to the qualification of any voter or as to whether any votes have been properly counted except at the general meeting or adjourned general meeting at which the vote objected to is given or tTerminationered and every vote not disallowed at the meeting shall be valid. Any objection made in due time and in accordance with these Articles shall be referred to the chairman whose decision shall be final and conclusive. Shareholder Restricted Matters 78A. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Memorandum or in these Articles or in the Law, for so long as HLNG is a Member, the Company shall not consent to or approve, and shall not permit any of Höegh LNG Colombia S.A.S. or Höegh LNG FSRU IV to consent to or approve, any of the following actions without the prior written consent of HLNG: 78A.1 any merger or consolidation involving any of the Company, Höegh LNG Colombia S.A.S. or Höegh LNG FSRU IV, or any of their respective subsidiaries; or 78A.2 any sale, exchange or Assignment of all or substantially all of the assets of any of the Company, Höegh LNG Colombia S.A.S. or Höegh LNG FSRU IV, or any of their respective subsidiaries; 78A.3 dissolution or liquidation of any of the Company, Höegh LNG Colombia S.A.S. or Höegh LNG FSRU IVor any of their respective subsidiaries; or 78A.4 creating or causing to exist any consensual restriction on the ability of any of the Company, Höegh LNG Colombia S.A.S. or Höegh LNG FSRU IV, or any of their respective subsidiaries, to make distributions, pay any indebtedness, make loans or advanes or Assignment assets to their respective owners, members or shareholders, or their respective subsidiaries; or 18 78A.5 settling or compromising any claim, dispute or Dispute Resolution directly against, or otherwise relating to indemnification by any of the Company, Höegh LNG Colombia S.A.S. or Höegh LNG FSRU IV, or any of their respective subsidiaries, of any of the directors or officers of HMLP, Höegh LNG Holdings Ltd. or HLNG, or their respective subsidiaries; or 78A.6 issuing any additional ownership interests in any of the Company, Höegh LNG Colombia S.A.S. or Höegh LNG FSRU IV[, or any of their respective subsidiaries]; or 78A.7 amTerminationing, supplementing or otherwise modifying, in whole or in part, the Memorandum or these Articles. PROXIES AND CORPORATE REPRESENTATIVES Members’ attTerminationance and voting 79. Subject to these Articles, each Member entitled to attTermination and vote at a general meeting may attTermination and vote at the general meeting: 79.1 in person, or where a Member is a company or non-natural person, by a duly authorised corporate representative; or 79.2 by one or more proxies. 80. A proxy or corporate representative need not be a Member. Appointment of proxies 81. The instrument appointing a proxy shall be in writing under the hand of the Member or his duly authorised attorney or, if the Member is a corporation, under the hand of its duly authorised representative. Form of proxy 82. An instrument appointing a proxy may be in any usual or common form (or such other form as the Directors may approve) and may be expressed to be for a particular meeting or any adjournment thereof or may appoint a standing proxy until notice of revocation is received at the Registered Office or at such place or places as the Directors may otherwise specify for the purpose. 19 Corporate representatives 83. Any corporation which is a Member of the Company may by resolution of its directors or other governing body authorise such person as it thinks fit to act as its representative at any meeting of the Company or of any class of Members of the Company, and the person so authorised shall be entitled to exercise the same powers on behalf of the corporation which he represents as that corporation could exercise if it were an individual Member of the Company. Receipt of instrument of appointment 84. The instrument appointing a proxy or corporate representative, and the power of attorney (if any) under which it is signed, together with such other evidence as to its due execution as the Directors may from time to time require, shall be deposited at the Registered Office of the Company or at such other place as is specified for that purpose in the notice convening the meeting or in any notice of any adjournment or, in either case or the case of a written resolution, in any document sent therewith, not less than 24 hours (or such longer or shorter time as the Directors may determine) before the time for holding the meeting or adjourned meeting at which the person named in the instrument proposes to vote. 85. In default of any of the provisions in these Articles to deposit any instrument of proxy or authorisation at the Registered Office of the Company or at such other place as is specified for that purpose in the notice convening the meeting, the instrument of proxy or authorisation shall not be treated as valid provided that the chairman of the meeting may in his discretion accept an instrument of proxy or authorisation sent by email or fax upon receipt of email or fax confirmation that the signed original thereof has been sent. 20 Standing Proxy 86. The operation of a standing proxy or authorisation shall be suspTerminationed at any general meeting or adjournment thereof at which the Member is present in person or by specially appointed proxy. The Directors may require evidence as to the due execution and continuing validity of any standing proxy or authorisation and the operation of any such standing proxy or authorisation shall be deemed to be suspTerminationed until the Directors determine that they have received such satisfactory evidence. Poll vote 87. In the case of a poll taken subsequently to the date of a meeting or adjourned meeting, the instrument appointing the proxy or corporate representative referred to in these Articles shall be deposited at the Registered Office of the Company or at such other place as is specified for that purpose in the notice convening the meeting before the time appointed for the taking of the poll. 88. The instrument appointing a proxy shall be deemed to confer authority to demand or join in demanding a poll, to speak at the meeting and to vote on any amTerminationment of a written resolution or amTerminationment of a resolution put to the meeting for which it is given as the proxy thinks fit.

Such appointment or removal shall be by notice to the Registered Office signed by the Director making or revoking the appointment or in any other manner approved by the Directors, and shall be effective on the date the notice is served and the alternate shall be notified of such appointment or revocation. Subject to the removal by the appointing Director, the alternate shall continue in office until the date on which his appointor ceases to be a Director.

An alternate Director shall be deemed for all purposes to be a Director and shall alone be responsible for his own acts and defaults and shall not be deemed to be the agent of the Director appointing him. The signature of an alternate to any resolution in writing of the Director or a committee there shall, unless the terms of the appointment provides to the contrary, be as effective as the signature of the Director or Directors to whom he is alternate. 28 Committees of Directors 124. The Directors may delegate any of their powers to committees consisting of such member or members of their body as they think fit; any committee so formed shall, in the exercise of the powers so delegated, conform to any regulations that may be imposed on it by the Directors. 125.

A committee may meet and adjourn as it thinks proper. Questions arising at any meeting shall be determined by a majority of votes of the members present and in case of an equality of votes the chairman shall not have a second or casting vote and the motion shall be deemed to have been lost. Officers 127. The Directors may appoint a Secretary and such other officers as they may from time to time consider necessary upon such terms as to duration of office, remuneration and otherwise as they may think fit. Such Secretary or other officers need not be Directors and in the case of the other officers may be ascribed such titles as the Directors may decide and the Directors may revoke or terminate any such election or appointment. Any such revocation or termination shall be without prejudice to any claim for any damages that such officer may have against the Company or the Company may have against such officer for any breach of any contract of service between him and the Company which may be involved in such revocation or termination. Save as provided in the Law or these Articles, the powers and duties of the officers of the Company shall be such (if any) as are determined from time to time by the Directors. DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION Remuneration 128. The remuneration to be paid to the Directors, if any, shall be determined by the Company in general meeting or, in the absence of such a determination, by the Directors. Expenses 129. Each Director shall also be entitled to be paid his reasonable travelling, hotel and other expenses properly incurred by him in connection with his attTerminationance at meetings of the Directors, committees of the Directors or general meetings of the Company, or otherwise in connection with the business of the Company, or to receive a fixed allowance in respect thereof as may be determined by the Directors, or a combination partly of one such method and partly the other. 29 Additional remuneration 130. The Directors may by resolution approve additional remuneration to any Director for services which in the opinion of the Directors go beyond the ordinary duties of a Director, and such extra remuneration shall be in addition to any remuneration provided for, by or pursuant to any other Article. SEALS AND DEEDS Use of Seal 131. The Directors may determine that the Company shall have a Seal, and if they so determine, shall provide for the safe custody of the Seal. The Seal shall only be used by the authority of the Directors and in the presence of a Director or the Secretary or such other person as the Directors may by resolution appoint for this purpose, and every instrument to which the Seal affixed shall be signed by the relevant person. Notwithstanding the above, annual returns and notices filed under the Law may be executed either as a deed or under Seal and in either case without the need for the authority of a resolution of the Directors. 30 Duplicate Seal 132. The Company may maintain in any place or places outside the Cayman Islands a facsimile of any Seal and such facsimile seal shall be affixed in the same way as if it were the Seal. Execution of deeds 133.

DIVIDTerminationS Payment of DividTerminations 134. The Directors may from time to time declare dividTerminations to be paid to the Members according to their rights and interests, including such interim dividTerminations as appear to the Directors to be justified by the position of the Company. The Directors may also pay any fixed cash dividTermination which is payable on any Shares of the Company half yearly or on such other dates, whenever the position of the Company, in the opinion of the Directors, justifies such payment. 135. No dividTermination shall be paid otherwise than out of profits or out of monies otherwise available for dividTermination in accordance with the Law. Calculation of DividTerminations 136. Subject to the rights of Members, if any, entitled to Shares with special rights as to dividTerminations, all dividTerminations shall be declared and paid according to the amount paid up on the Shares in respect of which the dividTermination is paid and any dividTermination on any class of Shares not fully paid shall be declared and paid according to the amounts paid on the Shares of that class, but if and so long as nothing is paid up on any of the Shares in the Company, dividTerminations may be declared and paid according to the number of Shares. No amount paid on a Share in advance of calls shall, while carrying interest, be treated for the purposes of this Article as paid on the Share. DividTerminations may be apportioned and paid pro rata according to the amounts paid-up on the Shares during any portion or portions of the period in respect of which the dividTermination is paid. 31 Deductions 137. The Directors may deduct from any dividTermination, distribution or other monies payable to a Member by the Company on or in respect of any Shares all sums of money (if any) presently payable by him to the Company on account of calls or otherwise in respect of Shares of the Company. Joint Holders 138. If several persons are registered as joint holders of any Share, any of them may give effectual receipts for any dividTermination or other money payable on or in respect of the Share. Payment method 139. Any dividTermination may be paid by cheque or warrant sent through the post to the address of the Member or person entitled thereto in the Register of Members or, in the case of joint holders addressed to the holder whose name stands first in the Register of Members in respect of the Shares at his registered address as appearing on the Register of Members or to such person and such address as the Member or person entitled or such joint holders as the case may be may direct in writing. Every such cheque or warrant shall, unless the holder or joint holders may in writing direct, be made payable to the order of the person to whom it is sent or to the order of the holder or, in the case of joint holders, to the order of the holder whose name stands first in the Register of Members in respect of such Shares, and shall be sent at his or their risk and payment of the cheque or warrant by the bank on which it is drawn shall constitute a good discharge to the Company. Any one of two or more joint holders may give effectual receipts for any dividTerminations, distributions or other monies payable or property distributable in respect of the Shares held by such joint holders. Satisfaction by distribution of specific assets 140. The Directors may declare that any dividTermination or distribution is paid wholly or partly by the distribution of specific assets and, in particular, of paid up shares, debentures or debenture stock of any other company or in any one or more of such ways, and where any difficulty arises in regard to such dividTermination or distribution, the Directors may settle the same as they think expedient, and in particular may issue fractional Shares or ignore fractions altogether and may fix the value for dividTermination or distribution of such specific assets or any part thereof and may determine that cash payments shall be made to any Members upon the basis of the value so fixed in order to secure equality of distribution, and may vest any such specific assets in trustees as may seem expedient to the Directors. 32 No interest 141. No dividTermination or other distribution or other monies payable by the Company on or in respect of any Share shall bear interest against the Company. Unclaimed dividTerminations 142. All unclaimed dividTerminations or distributions may be invested or otherwise made use of by the Directors for the benefit of the Company until claimed. Any dividTermination or distribution unclaimed by a Member six years after the dividTermination or distribution payment date shall be forfeited and revert to the Company. RESERVES 143. The Directors may, before declaring any dividTermination or distribution, set aside such sums as they think proper as a reserve or reserves which shall, at the discretion of the Directors, be applicable for meeting contingencies, or for equalising dividTerminations, or for any other purpose of the Company, and pTerminationing such application may, in their discretion, be employed in the business of the Company or be invested in such manner as the Directors may from time to time think fit. The Directors may also without placing the same to reserve carry forward any sums which they think it prudent not to distribute. CAPITALISATION OF PROFITS Capitalisation 144. The Directors may capitalise any sum standing to the credit of any of the Company’s reserve accounts which are available for distribution (including its Share Premium Account and capital redemption reserve fund, subject to the Law) or any sum standing to the credit of the profit and loss account or otherwise available for distribution and to appropriate such sums to Members in the proportions in which such sum would have been divisible amongst them had the same been a distribution of profits by way of dividTermination and to apply such sum on their behalf in paying up in full unissued Shares for allotment and distribution credited as fully paid-up to and amongst them in the proportion aforesaid. Authorisation 145. Where any difficulty arises in regard to any distribution under the last preceding Article, the Directors may settle the same as they think expedient and, in particular, may authorise any person to sell and Assignment any fractions or may resolve that the distribution should be as nearly as may be practicable in the correct proportion but not exactly so or may ignore fractions altogether, and may determine that cash payments should be made to any Members in order to adjust the rights of all parties, as may seem expedient to the Directors. The Directors may appoint any person to sign on behalf of the persons entitled to participate in the distribution any contract necessary or desirable for giving effect thereto and such appointment shall be effective and binding upon the Members. 33 SHARE PREMIUM ACCOUNT 146. The Directors shall in accordance with the Law establish a Share Premium Account and shall carry to the credit of such account from time to time a sum equal to the amount or value of the premium paid on the issue of any Share. 147. There shall be debited to any Share Premium Account on the redemption or purchase of a Share the difference between the nominal value of such Share and the redemption or purchase price provided always that at the discretion of the Directors such sum may be paid out of the profits of the Company or, if permitted by the Law, out of capital. ACCOUNTING RECORDS Books of account 148. The Directors shall cause to be kept accounting records sufficient to give a true and fair view of the state of the Company's affairs and to show and explain its transactions and otherwise in accordance with the Law. Inspection by Members 149. The accounting records shall be kept at the Registered Office or at such other place or places as the Directors think fit, and shall at all times be open to inspection by the Directors. No Member (who is not also a Director) shall have any right to inspect any accounting record or book or document of the Company except as conferred by law or authorised by the Directors or by the Members by Ordinary Resolution. Records and audit 150. From time to time the Company in general meeting may determine (or revoke, alter or amTermination any such determination) or, failing such determination, the Directors may determine (or revoke, alter or amTermination any such determination): 150.1 that the accounts of the Company be audited and the appointment of the Auditors; 150.2 that there be prepared and sent to each Member and other person entitled thereto a profit and loss account, a balance sheet, group accounts and/or reports for such period and on such terms as they may determine; and 150.3 that there be laid before the Company in general meeting a copy of every balance sheet together with a copy of the Auditor's report. 34 SERVICE OF NOTICES AND DOCUMENTS Form and delivery of notices 151. Notices or other documents or communications may be given to any Member by the Company either personally or by sTerminationing it by courier, post, fax or email to him to his registered address, or (if he has no registered address) to the address, if any, supplied by him to the Company for the giving of notices to him. Any notice shall be deemed to be effected: 151.1 if delivered personally or sent by courier, by properly addressing and prepaying a letter containing the notice; and to have been effected, in the case of a notice of a meeting, when delivered; 151.2 if sent by post, by properly addressing, prepaying, and posting a letter containing the notice (by airmail if available) and to have been effected, in the case of a notice of a meeting, at the Termination of three days after it was posted; and 151.3 if sent by fax or email by properly addressing and sTerminationing such notice through the appropriate transmitting medium and to have been effected on the day the same is sent. 152. A notice may be given by the Company to the joint holders of a Share by giving the notice to the joint holder named first in the Register of Members in respect of the Share. 153. A notice may be given by the Company to the person entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a Member by sTerminationing it through the post in a prepaid letter addressed to them by name, or by the title of representatives of the deceased, or trustee of the bankrupt, or by any like description, at the address, if any, supplied for the purpose by the persons claiming to be so entitled, or (until such an address has been so supplied) by giving the notice in any manner in which the same might have been given if the death or bankruptcy had not occurred. 154. Notice of every general meeting shall be given in any manner hereinbefore authorised to: 154.1 every Member entitled to vote except those Members entitled to vote who (having no registered address) have not supplied to the Company an address for the giving of notices to them; and 154.2 every person entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a Member, who, but for his death or bankruptcy would be entitled to receive notice of the meeting. 155. No other persons shall be entitled to receive notices of general meeting. 35 WINDING UP Method of winding up 156. Subject to the rights attaching to any Shares, if the Company shall be wound up, the liquidator may, with the sanction of a Special Resolution and any other sanction required by the Law or these Articles, divide amongst the Members in kind the whole or any part of the assets of the Company (whether they shall consist of property of the same kind or not) and may for such purpose set such value as he deems fair upon any property to be divided as aforesaid and may determine how such division shall be carried out as between the Members or different classes of Members. The liquidator may, with the like sanction, vest the whole or any part of such assets in trustees upon such trusts for the benefit of the contributories as the liquidator, with the like sanction, shall think fit, but so that no Member shall be compelled to accept any asset upon which there is any liability. Distribution of assets 157. If the Company shall be wound up and the assets available for distribution amongst the Members as such shall be insufficient to repay the whole of the paid up capital, such assets shall be distributed so that, as nearly as may be, the losses shall be borne by the Members in proportion to the capital paid up, or which ought to have been paid up, at the commencement of the winding up, on the Shares held by them respectively. And if in a winding up the assets available for distribution amongst the Members shall be more than sufficient to repay the whole of the capital paid up at the commencement of the winding up, the excess shall be distributed amongst the Members in proportion to the capital paid up at the commencement of the winding up on the Shares held by them respectively. This Article is to be without prejudice to the rights of the holders of Shares issued upon special terms and conditions. Indemnification Indemnification and limitation of liability 158. Every Indemnified Person shall, in the absence of wilful neglect or default, be indemnified and held harmless out of the assets of the Company against all liabilities, loss, damage, cost or expense (including but not limited to liabilities under contract, tort and statute or any applicable foreign law or regulation and all reasonable legal and other costs and expenses on a full Indemnification basis properly payable) incurred or suffered by him by or by reason of any act done, conceived in or omitted in the conduct of the Company’s business or in the discharge of his duties and the Indemnification contained in this Article shall extTermination to any Indemnified Person acting in any office or trust in the reasonable belief that he has been appointed or elected to such office or trust notwithstanding any defect in such appointment or election. 36 159. No Indemnified Person shall be liable to the Company for acts, defaults or omissions of any other Indemnified Person. Indemnification and reimbursement 160. Every Indemnified Person shall be indemnified out of the funds of the Company against all liabilities incurred by him by or by reason of any act done, conceived in or omitted in the conduct of the Company’s business or in the discharge of his duties in defTerminationing any proceedings, whether civil or criminal, in which judgment is given in his favour, or in which he is acquitted, or in connection with any application in which relief from liability is granted to him by the court. 161. To the extent that any Indemnified Person is entitled to claim an Indemnification pursuant to these Articles in respect of amounts paid or discharged by him, the relative Indemnification shall take effect as an obligation of the Company to reimburse the person making such payment or effecting such discharge. Wilful neglect or default 162. Each Member and the Company agree to waive any claim or right of action he or it may at any time have, whether individually or by or in the right of the Company, against any Indemnified Person on account of any act or omission of such Indemnified Person in the performance of his duties for the Company; provided however, that such waiver shall not apply to any claims or rights of action arising out of the wilful neglect or default of such Indemnified Person or to recover any gain, personal profit or advantage to which such Indemnified Person is not legally entitled.

If he shall elect to Assignment the Shares, he shall signify his election by signing an instrument of Assignment of such Shares in favour of his Assignmentee. All the limitations, restrictions and provisions of these Articles relating to the right to Assignment and the registration of Assignments of Shares shall be applicable to any such notice or instrument of Assignment as aforesaid as if the death of the Member or other event giving rise to the transmission had not occurred and the notice or instrument of Assignment was an instrument of Assignment signed by such Member. Rights of persons entitled on transmission 24. A person becoming entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of the Member (or otherwise by operation of Governing Law), upon such evidence being produced as may be required by the Directors as to his entitlement, shall be entitled to the same dividTerminations and other monies payable in respect of the Share as he would be entitled if he were the holder of such Share. However, he shall not be entitled, until he becomes registered as the holder of such Share, to receive notices of or to attTermination or vote at general meetings of the Company or (except as aforesaid) to exercise any other rights or privileges of a Member. The Directors may at any time give notice requiring such person to elect either to be registered himself or to Assignment the Share and, if the notice is not complied with within sixty days, the Directors may thereafter withhold payment of all dividTerminations and other monies payable in respect of the Shares until the requirements of the notice have been complied with. REDEMPTION AND PURCHASE OF SHARES 25. Subject to the provisions of the Law and the Memorandum, the Company may: 25.1 purchase its own Shares (including any redeemable Shares) in such manner and on such terms as the Directors may agree with the relevant Member unless following such purchase there would no longer be any issued Shares and may make payment for such purchase or for any redemption of Shares in any manner authorised by the Law, including out of capital; and 25.2 reduce its share capital and any capital redemption reserve fund in any manner whatsoever. 8 VARIATION OF SHARE RIGHTS Variation of class rights 26. If at any time the share capital is divided into different classes of Shares, all or any of the special rights attached to any class of Shares (unless otherwise provided by the terms of issue of the Shares of that class) may be varied or abrogated with the consent in writing of the holders of not less than two thirds of the issued Shares of that class or with the sanction of a resolution passed by the holders of not less than two thirds of the issued Shares of that class as may be present in person or by proxy at a separate general meeting of the holders of the Shares of that class. To any such separate general meeting, all of the provisions of these Articles relating to general meetings shall mutatis mutandis apply, but so that the necessary quorum shall be any one or more persons holding or representing by proxy not less than one third of the issued Shares of the class and that any holder of Shares of the relevant class present in person or by proxy may demand a poll. Treatment of classes 27. For the purpose of a separate class meeting, the Directors may treat two or more of all classes of Shares as forming one class if they consider that such class of Shares would be affected in the same way by the proposals under consideration. Effect of Share issue on class rights 28. The rights conferred upon the holders of any Shares shall not, unless otherwise expressly provided in the rights attaching to such Shares, be deemed to be altered by the creation or issue of further Shares ranking pari passu therewith. NON-RECOGNITION OF TRUSTS 29. Except as required by the Law or these Articles, or under an order of a court of competent jurisdiction, the Company shall not be bound by or compelled to recognise in any way, even when notice thereof is given to it, any equitable, contingent, future or partial interest in any Share, or any other rights in respect of any Share other than an absolute right to the entirety thereof in the registered holder. 9 LIEN Lien generally 30. The Company shall have a first and paramount lien on every Share (not being a fully paid Share) for all moneys (whether presently payable or not) called or payable at a date fixed by or in accordance with the terms of issue of such Share in respect of that Share, and the Company shall also have a first and paramount lien on every Share (other than a fully paid up Share) standing registered in the name of a Member, whether singly or jointly with any other person for all debts and liabilities of a Member or his estate to the Company, whether the same shall have been incurred before or after notice to the Company of any interest of any person other than such Member, and whether the time for the payment or discharge of the same shall have actually arrived or not, and notwithstanding that the same are joint debts or liabilities of such Member or his estate and any other person, whether a Member or not. The Directors may at any time, either generally or in any particular case, waive any lien that has arisen or declare any Share to be wholly or in part exempt from the provisions of this Article. The Company's lien, if any, on a Share shall extTermination to all dividTerminations payable thereon. Enforcement 31. The Company may sell, in such manner as the Directors think fit, any Share on which the Company has a lien, provided a sum in respect of which the lien exists is presently payable, and is not paid within fourteen days after a notice in writing has been given to the registered holder  for the time being of the Share, demanding payment of the sum presently payable and giving notice of the intention to sell in default of such payment. Completion of sale 32. For giving effect to any such sale, the Directors may authorise any person to Assignment the Share sold to the purchaser thereof. The purchaser shall be registered as the holder of the Share comprised in any such Assignment and he shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money, nor shall his title to the Share be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings relating to the sale. Application of proceeds 33. The net proceeds of such sale shall be applied in payment or discharge of the debt or liability in respect of which the lien exists and as is presently payable, and any balance shall (subject to a like lien for debts or liabilities not presently payable as existed upon the Shares prior to the sale) be paid to the person who was the registered holder of the Share immediately before such sale. CALLS ON SHARES Calls on Shares generally 34. The Directors may from time to time make calls upon the Members in respect of any moneys unpaid on their Shares (whether in respect of the par value of the Shares or premium or otherwise and not, by the terms of issue thereof, made payable at a future date fixed by or in accordance with such terms of issue); and each Member shall (subject to the Company serving upon him at least 14 days’ notice specifying the time or times and place of payment) pay to the Company at the time or times and place so specified the amount called on his Shares. A call may be revoked or postponed by the Directors wholly or in part as the Directors may determine. A call shall be deemed to have been made at the time when the resolution of the Directors authorising the call was passed. 10 Payment 35. Payment of a call may be made by instalments on the direction of the Directors. 36. If a sum called in respect of a Share is not paid before or on the day appointed for payment thereof, the person from whom the sum is due shall pay interest on the sum from the day payment is due to the time of the actual payment at such rate as the Directors may determine, but the Directors may waive payment of such interest wholly or in part. 37. Any sum payable in respect of a Share on issue or allotment or at any fixed date, whether in respect of the par value of the Share or premium or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a call and if it is not paid all the relevant provisions as to payment of interest, forfeiture or otherwise of these Articles shall apply as if such sum had become due and payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified. 38. The Directors may issue Shares with different terms as to the amount and times of payment of calls. Liability of joint holders 39. The joint holders of a Share shall be jointly and severally liable to pay calls in respect thereof. Interest 40. The Directors may, if they think fit, receive from any Member willing to advance the same, all or any part of the moneys uncalled and unpaid upon any Shares held by him; and may (until the amount would otherwise become payable) pay interest at such rate (not exceeding six per cent without the sanction of the Company in general meeting) as may be agreed upon between the Member paying the sum in advance and the Directors. FORFEITURE OF SHARES Notice 41. If a Member fails to pay any call or instalment of a call by the date it becomes due and payable, the Directors may, at any time thereafter while such call or instalment remains unpaid, give notice to the Member requiring payment of the unpaid portion of the call or instalment, together with any accrued interest and expenses incurred by the Company by reason of such non-payment. 11 42. The notice shall specify where and by what date (not being less than the Termination of 14 days’ from the date of the notice) payment is to be made and shall state that if it is not complied with the Shares in respect of which the call was made will be liable to be forfeited. The Directors may accept the surrTerminationer of any Share liable to be forfeited hereunder and, in such case, references to these Articles to forfeiture shall include surrTerminationer. Forfeiture for non-compliance 43. If such notice is not complied with, any Share in respect of which the notice was given may thereafter, before the payment of all calls or instalments and interest due in respect thereof has been made, be forfeited by a resolution of the Directors. Such forfeiture shall include all dividTerminations declared, other distributions or other monies payable in respect of the forfeited Shares and not paid before the forfeiture. Forfeited Shares 44. A forfeited Share may be sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed of upon such terms and in such manner as the Directors shall think fit, and at any time before a sale, re-allotment or disposition, the forfeiture may be cancelled on such terms as the Directors think fit. Continued liability for forfeited Member 45. A person whose Shares have been forfeited shall cease to be a Member in respect of the forfeited Shares, but shall remain liable to pay to the Company all moneys which at the date of forfeiture were presently payable by him in respect of the Shares together with interest at such rate as the Directors may determine from the date of forfeiture until payment, but his liability shall cease if and when the Company receives payment in full of all amounts due in respect of the Shares. The Company may enforce payment without being under any obligation to make any allowance for the value of the Shares forfeited. Evidence of forfeiture 46. An affidavit in writing by a Director or Secretary of the Company that a Share has been duly forfeited on a specified date, shall be conclusive evidence of the facts stated in it as against all persons claiming to be entitled to the Share. The Company may receive the consideration, if any, given for the Share on any sale, re-allotment or disposition thereof and may authorise some person to execute a Assignment of the Share in favour of the person to whom the Share is sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed of, and he shall thereupon be registered as the holder of the Share, and shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money (if any) nor shall his title to the Share be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings in reference to the forfeiture, sale, re-allotment or disposition of the Share. 12 47. The provisions of these Articles as to forfeiture shall apply in the case of non-payment of any sum which, by the terms of issue of a Share, becomes payable at a fixed time, whether on account of the par value of the Share, or by way of premium or otherwise, as if the same had been made payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified to the Member. INCREASE OF CAPITAL 48. The Company may from time to time by Ordinary Resolution increase its share capital by such sum, to be divided into new Shares of such par value, and with such rights, priorities and privileges attached thereto as the resolution shall prescribe. 49. Subject to any directions given by the Company in a general meeting, all new Shares shall be at the disposal of the Directors in accordance with these Articles. 50. The new Shares shall be subject to the same provisions of these Articles with reference to the payment of calls, lien, forfeiture, Assignment, transmission and otherwise, as the Shares in the original share capital. ALTERATION OF CAPITAL 51. The Company may from time to time by Ordinary Resolution: 51.1 consolidate and divide all or any of its share capital into Shares of larger par value than its existing Shares; 51.2 sub divide its existing Shares, or any of them, into Shares of smaller par value than is fixed by the Memorandum, subject nevertheless to the provisions of section 13 of the Law; 51.3 cancel any Shares which, at the date of the passing of the resolution, have not been taken or agreed to be taken by any person; and 51.4 convert all or any paid up Shares into stock, and reconvert all or any stock into paid up Shares of any denomination. 52. The Company may from time to time by Special Resolution: 52.1 divide its Shares into several classes and attach to such classes any preferential, deferred, or special rights or restrictions in accordance with these Articles; 52.2 change the currency denomination of its share capital; 13 52.3 reduce its share capital and any capital redemption reserve fund in any manner whatsoever; and 52.4 merge or consolidate with any one or more constituent companies (as defined in the Law). GENERAL MEETINGS Convening a meeting 53. The Directors may, whenever they think fit, convene an extraordinary general meeting. If at any time there are not sufficient Directors capable of acting to form a quorum, any Director, or any one or more Members holding in the aggregate not less than one third of the total issued share capital of the Company entitled to vote, may convene an extraordinary general meeting in the same manner as nearly as possible as that in which meetings may be convened by the Directors. Members’ requisition 54. The Directors shall, upon the requisition in writing of one or more Members holding in the aggregate not less than one tenth of such paid up capital of the Company as at the date of the requisition carries the right of voting at general meetings, convene an extraordinary general meeting. Any such requisition shall express the object of the meeting proposed to be called, and must be signed by the requisitionists and deposited at the Registered Office, and may consist of several documents in like form, each signed by one or more requisitionists. 55. If there are no Directors as at the date of the deposit of the Members’ requisition or if the Directors do not convene a general meeting within 21 days from the date of the deposit, the requisitionists or any or any of them or any other Member or Members holding in the aggregate not less than one tenth of such paid up capital of the Company as at the date of the requisition, may convene an extraordinary general meeting. A general meeting convened by requisitionists shall be convened in the same manner as nearly as possible as that in which general meetings are to be convened by the Directors. NOTICE OF GENERAL MEETINGS Length and form of notice 56. At least five clear days’ notice shall be given of any general meeting. Every notice shall specify the place, the day and the time of meeting and, in the case of special business, the general nature of the business to be conducted at the general meeting, and shall be given in the manner provided in these Articles or in such other manner (if any) as may be prescribed by the Company, to such persons as are entitled to receive such notices from the Company. A general meeting may be convened by such shorter notice, or without notice, by a majority in number of the Members having the right to attTermination and vote at the meeting, being a majority together holding not less than ninety-five percent in nominal value of the Shares giving that right. 14 Omission or non-receipt 57. The accidental omission to give notice of a meeting to, or the non-receipt of a notice of a meeting by, any Member entitled to receive notice shall not invalidate the proceedings at any meeting. PROCEEDINGS AT GENERAL MEETINGS 58. All business shall be deemed special that is transacted at an extraordinary general meeting. Quorum 59. No business shall be transacted at any general meeting unless a quorum of Members is present at the time that the meeting proceeds to business, but the absence of a quorum shall not preclude the appointment, choice or election of a chairman, which shall not be treated as part of the business of the Meeting. Save as herein otherwise provided, one or more Members holding in the aggregate not less than one third of the total issued share capital of the Company present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall be a quorum. Adjournment for lack of quorum 60. If within five minutes (or such longer time as the chairman of the meeting may determine to wait) after the time appointed for the meeting, a quorum is not present, the meeting, if convened upon the requisition of Members, shall be dissolved. In any other case, it shall stand adjourned to the same day in the next week, at the same time and place, and if at the adjourned meeting a quorum is not present within half an hour from the time appointed for the meeting, the Members present shall be a quorum. Meeting by telephone or other facilities 61. A meeting of the Members may be held by telephone, electronic or other communication facilities (including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, by telephone or video conferencing) by which all persons participating in the meeting can communicate with each other simultaneously and instantaneously, and participation in such a general meeting shall constitute presence in person at such meeting. 62. Any Director shall be entitled to attTermination and speak at any general meeting of the Company. 15 Appointment of chairman 63. The chairman (if any) of the Board of Directors shall preside as chairman at every general meeting of the Company. If there is no such chairman, or if at any meeting he is not present within five minutes after the time appointed for holding the meeting or is unwilling to act as chairman, the Directors present shall choose one of their number to act or, if only one Director is present, he shall preside as chairman if willing to act. If no Director is present, or if each of the Directors present declines to take the chair, the Members present and entitled to vote shall elect one of their number to be chairman. Adjournment of meeting 64. The chairman may, with the consent of a meeting at which a quorum is present (and shall if so directed by the meeting) adjourn the meeting from time to time and from place to place, but no business shall be transacted at any adjourned meeting other than the business left unfinished at the meeting from which the adjournment took place. When a meeting is adjourned for ten days or more, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given as in the case of an original meeting. Save as aforesaid, it shall not be necessary to give any notice of an adjournment or of the business to be transacted at an adjourned meeting. VOTING Ordinary Resolution Save where a Special Resolution or other greater majority is required by the Law or these Articles, any question proposed for consideration at any general meeting shall be decided by an Ordinary Resolution. Voting on a show of hands 65. At any general meeting, a resolution put to the vote of the meeting shall be decided on a show of hands, unless before or on the declaration of the result of the show of hands, or on the withdrawal of any other demand for a poll. Demand for poll 66. A poll is demanded by: 66.1 the chairman of the meeting; or 66.2 at least three Members present in person or by proxy; or 66.3 any Member or Members present in person or by proxy and holding collectively not less than one tenth of the total voting rights of all the Members having the right to vote at such meeting; or 16 66.4 a Member or Members present in person or by proxy holding Shares conferring the right to vote at such meeting, being Shares on which an aggregate sum has been paid up equal to not less than one tenth of the total sum paid up on all such Shares conferring such right. 67. Unless a poll is duly demanded and the demand is not withdrawn, a declaration by the chairman that a resolution has, on a show of hands, been carried or carried unanimously, or by a particular majority, or lost and an entry to that effect in the minutes of the proceedings of the Company shall be conclusive evidence of that fact, without proof of the number or proportion of the votes recorded in favour of, or against, that resolution. The demand for a poll may be withdrawn by the person or any persons making it at any time prior to the declaration of the result of the poll. 68. If a poll is duly demanded, it shall be taken in such manner as the chairman directs, and the result of the poll shall be deemed to be the resolution of the meeting at which the poll was demanded. 69. In the case of an equality of votes at a general meeting, whether on a show of hands or on a poll, the chairman of the meeting at which the show of hands takes place or at which the poll is demanded, shall not be entitled to a second or casting vote and the resolution shall fail. 70. A poll demanded on the election of a chairman or on a question of adjournment shall be taken forthwith. A poll demanded on any other question shall be taken in such manner and either forthwith or at such time later in the meeting as the chairman of the meeting shall direct. 71. The demand for a poll shall not prevent the continuance of a meeting for the transaction of any business other than the question on which the poll has been demanded and it may be withdrawn at any time before the close of the meeting or the taking of the poll, whichever is the earlier. Voting on a poll 72. On a poll votes may be cast either personally or by proxy. 73. A person entitled to more than one vote on a poll need not use all his votes or cast all the votes he uses in the same way. 74. On a show of hands, every Member present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall have one vote. On a poll, every Member present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall have one vote for each Share of which he is the registered holder. 17 75. In the case of joint holders of a Share, the vote of the senior who tTerminationers a vote, whether in person or by proxy, shall be accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint holders; and for this purpose seniority shall be determined by the order in which the names stand in the Register of Members in respect of the joint holding. 76. A Member of unsound mind, or, in respect of whom an order has been made by any court having jurisdiction in lunacy, may vote, whether on a show of hands or on a poll, by his receiver, committee, curator bonis or other person of similar nature appointed by such court, and any such receiver, committee, curator bonis or other person may vote by proxy and may otherwise act and be treated as such Member for the purpose of the general meetings. 77. No Member, unless the Directors otherwise determine, shall be entitled to vote at any general meeting, unless all calls or other sums presently payable by him in respect of Shares in the Company have been paid. 78. No objection shall be raised as to the qualification of any voter or as to whether any votes have been properly counted except at the general meeting or adjourned general meeting at which the vote objected to is given or tTerminationered and every vote not disallowed at the meeting shall be valid. Any objection made in due time and in accordance with these Articles shall be referred to the chairman whose decision shall be final and conclusive. Shareholder Restricted Matters 78A.

The instrument appointing a proxy shall be deemed to confer authority to demand or join in demanding a poll, to speak at the meeting and to vote on any amTerminationment of a written resolution or amTerminationment of a resolution put to the meeting for which it is given as the proxy thinks fit. The instrument of proxy or authorisation shall, unless the contrary is stated therein, be valid as well for any adjournment of the meeting as for the meeting to which it relates.

No document or deed otherwise duly executed and delivered by or on behalf of the Company shall be regarded as invalid merely because at the date of delivery of the deed or document, the Director, Secretary or other officer or person who shall have executed the same and/or affixed the Seal (if any) thereto as the case may be for and on behalf of the Company shall have ceased to hold such office or to hold such authority on behalf of the Company. Executive Directors 102. The Directors may from time to time appoint one of their number to be a managing director, joint managing director or an assistant managing director or to hold any other employment or executive office with the Company for such period and upon such terms as the Directors may determine and may revoke or terminate any such appointments. Any such revocation or termination as aforesaid shall be without prejudice to any claim for damages that such Director may have against the Company or the Company may have against such Director for any breach of any contract of service between him and the Company which may be involved in such revocation or termination. Any person so appointed shall receive such remuneration (if any) (whether by way of salary, commission, participation in profits or otherwise) as the Directors may determine, and either in addition to or in lieu of his remuneration as a Director. 24 Sole Director 103. Notwithstanding any provision in these Articles to the contrary, a sole Director shall be entitled to exercise all of the powers and functions of the Directors which may be imposed on them by Law or by these Articles. PROCEEDINGS OF DIRECTORS Regulating proceedings 104. The Directors may meet together (either within or without the Cayman Islands) for the despatch of business, adjourn and otherwise regulate their meetings and proceedings, as they think fit. Questions arising at any meeting shall be decided by a majority of votes. In case of an equality of votes the chairman shall not have a second or casting vote and the motion shall be deemed to have been lost. Convening a meeting 105. A Director or alternate Director may, and the Secretary on the requisition of a Director or alternate Director shall, at any time, summon a meeting of Directors by at least five days’ notice in writing to every Director and alternate Director which notice shall set forth the general nature of the business to be considered provided however that notice may be waived by all the Directors (or their alternates) either at, before or retrospectively after the meeting is held provided further that notice or waiver thereof may be given by email or fax. Quorum 106. The quorum for the transaction of the business of the Directors may be fixed by the Directors and unless so fixed by the Directors, shall be [three] Directors consisting of at least [two] HLMP Directors, and shall be one if there is a sole Director . An alternate appointed by a Director shall be counted in a quorum at a meeting at which the Director appointing him is not present provided always that where a Director is acting in his own right and also as an alternate he is only counted once in the quorum. A Director who ceases to be a Director at a meeting of the Directors may continue to be present and to act as a Director and be counted in the quorum until the termination of the meeting provided no other Director objects and if otherwise a quorum of Directors would not be present. Vacancies 107. The continuing Directors may act notwithstanding any vacancy in their body, but, if and so long as their number is reduced below the number fixed by or pursuant to these Articles as the necessary quorum of Directors, the continuing Directors may act for the purpose of increasing the number of Directors to that number, or of summoning a general meeting of the Company, but for no other purpose. 25 Chairman 108. The Directors may elect a chairman of their meetings and determine the period for which he is to hold office; but if no such chairman is elected, or if at any meeting the chairman is not present within five minutes after the time appointed for holding the same, the Directors present may choose one of their number to be chairman of the meeting. Written resolutions of Directors 109. A resolution in writing signed by all of the Directors or all of the members of a committee of Directors for the time being entitled to receive notice of a meeting of the Directors (or by an alternate Director as provided in these Articles), including a resolution signed in counterpart and/or sent or evidenced by way of signed fax or electronic transmission, shall be as valid and effectual as if it had been passed at a meeting of the Directors or of a committee of Directors duly called and constituted. Meeting by telephone or other facilities 110. To the extent permitted by law, a meeting of the Directors or a committee appointed by the Directors may be held by means of such telephone, electronic or other communication facilities (including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, by telephone or by video conferencing) as permit all persons participating in the meeting to communicate with each other simultaneously and instantaneously and participation in such a meeting shall constitute presence in person at such meeting. Such a meeting shall be deemed to take place where the largest group of those Directors participating in the meeting is physically assembled, or, if there is no such group, where the chairman of the meeting then is. Validity of acts in spite of defect 111. All acts done by any meeting of the Directors or of a committee of Directors, or by any person acting as a Director shall, notwithstanding that it be afterwards discovered that there was some defect in the appointment of any such Director or person acting as aforesaid, or that they or any of them were disqualified, be as valid as if every such person had been duly appointed and was qualified to be a Director. Minutes 112. The Directors shall cause minutes to be made and records kept for the purpose of recording: 26 112.1 all appointments of officers made by the Directors; 112.2 the names of the Directors and other persons present at each meeting of the Directors and of any committee of the Directors; and 112.3 all resolutions and proceedings at all meetings of the Members of the Company or any class of Members and of the Directors and of committees of Directors; and the chairman of all such meetings or of any meeting confirming the minutes thereof shall sign the same. DIRECTORS’ INTERESTS 113. A Director may hold any other office or place of profit with the Company (except that of Auditor) in conjunction with his office of Director for such period and upon such terms as to remuneration and otherwise as the Directors may determine. 114. A Director or officer may act by himself or his firm in a professional capacity for the Company (otherwise than as Auditor), and he or his firm shall be entitled to remuneration for professional services as if he were not a Director or officer. 115. No Director or officer shall be disqualified from his office or prevented by such office from holding any office or place of profit under the Company or under any company in which the Company shall be a Member or have any interest, or from contracting with the Company, either as vTerminationor, purchaser or otherwise, nor shall any such contract or any contract or transaction entered into by or on behalf of the Company in which any Director or officer shall be in any way interested be or be liable to be avoided nor shall any Director or officer so contracting, dealing or being so interested be liable to account to the Company for any profit realised by any such contract or transaction by reason of such Director holding office or of the fiduciary relation thereby established. Disclosure and nature of interest 116. A Director (or his alternate Director in his absence) shall be at liberty to vote in respect of any contract or transaction in which he is interested provided that the nature of the interest of the Director in any such contract or transaction shall be disclosed by him at or prior to its consideration and any vote thereon. 117. The nature of the interest of any Director or officer in any contract, dealing or transacting with or affecting the Company shall be disclosed by him at or prior to its consideration and any vote thereon and a general notice that a Director or officer is a shareholder of any specified firm or company and/or is to be regarded as interested in any transaction with such firm or company shall be sufficient disclosure hereunder and after such general notice it shall not be necessary to give special notice relating to any particular transaction. 27 DELEGATION OF DIRECTORS’ POWERS Power to delegate 118. Directors may from time to time and at any time by power of attorney or otherwise appoint any company, firm or person or fluctuating body of persons, whether nominated directly or indirectly by the Directors, to be the attorney or attorneys of the Company for such purposes and with such powers, authorities and discretions (not exceeding those vested in or exercisable by the Directors under these Articles) and for such period and subject to such conditions as they may think fit, and any such power of attorney may contain such provisions for the protection and convenience of persons dealing with any such attorney and of such attorney as the Directors may think fit and may also authorise any such attorney to delegate all or any of the powers, authorities and discretions vested in him. 119. The Directors may delegate any of the powers exercisable by them to a Managing Director , Director or any other person or persons acting individually or jointly as they may from time to time by resolution appoint upon such terms and conditions and with such restrictions as they may think fit, and may from time to time by resolution revoke, withdraw, alter or vary all or any such powers. Alternate Directors 120. Any Director may by writing appoint any other Director, or other person willing to act, to be his alternate and remove his alternate so appointed by him. Such appointment or removal shall be by notice to the Registered Office signed by the Director making or revoking the appointment or in any other manner approved by the Directors, and shall be effective on the date the notice is served and the alternate shall be notified of such appointment or revocation. Subject to the removal by the appointing Director, the alternate shall continue in office until the date on which his appointor ceases to be a Director. An alternate may also be a Director in his own right and may act as alternate to more than one Director. 121. An alternate shall be entitled to receive notice of all meetings of the Directors, attTermination, be counted in the quorum, vote and act in such appointor’s place at every such meeting at which the appointing Director is not personally present, and generally to perform all the functions of his appointor as a Director in his absence. 122. These Articles (except as regards powers to appoint an alternate and remuneration) apply equally to the alternate as though he were the Director in his own right. 123. An alternate Director shall be deemed for all purposes to be a Director and shall alone be responsible for his own acts and defaults and shall not be deemed to be the agent of the Director appointing him. The signature of an alternate to any resolution in writing of the Director or a committee there shall, unless the terms of the appointment provides to the contrary, be as effective as the signature of the Director or Directors to whom he is alternate. 28 Committees of Directors 124. The Directors may delegate any of their powers to committees consisting of such member or members of their body as they think fit; any committee so formed shall, in the exercise of the powers so delegated, conform to any regulations that may be imposed on it by the Directors. 125. A committee may elect a chairman of its meetings; if no such chairman is elected, or if at any meeting the chairman is not present within five minutes after the time appointed for holding the same, the members present may choose one of their number to be chairman of the meeting. 126. A committee may meet and adjourn as it thinks proper. Questions arising at any meeting shall be determined by a majority of votes of the members present and in case of an equality of votes the chairman shall not have a second or casting vote and the motion shall be deemed to have been lost. Officers 127. The Directors may appoint a Secretary and such other officers as they may from time to time consider necessary upon such terms as to duration of office, remuneration and otherwise as they may think fit. Such Secretary or other officers need not be Directors and in the case of the other officers may be ascribed such titles as the Directors may decide and the Directors may revoke or terminate any such election or appointment. Any such revocation or termination shall be without prejudice to any claim for any damages that such officer may have against the Company or the Company may have against such officer for any breach of any contract of service between him and the Company which may be involved in such revocation or termination. Save as provided in the Law or these Articles, the powers and duties of the officers of the Company shall be such (if any) as are determined from time to time by the Directors. DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION Remuneration 128. The remuneration to be paid to the Directors, if any, shall be determined by the Company in general meeting or, in the absence of such a determination, by the Directors. Expenses 129. Each Director shall also be entitled to be paid his reasonable travelling, hotel and other expenses properly incurred by him in connection with his attTerminationance at meetings of the Directors, committees of the Directors or general meetings of the Company, or otherwise in connection with the business of the Company, or to receive a fixed allowance in respect thereof as may be determined by the Directors, or a combination partly of one such method and partly the other. 29 Additional remuneration 130. The Directors may by resolution approve additional remuneration to any Director for services which in the opinion of the Directors go beyond the ordinary duties of a Director, and such extra remuneration shall be in addition to any remuneration provided for, by or pursuant to any other Article. SEALS AND DEEDS Use of Seal 131. The Directors may determine that the Company shall have a Seal, and if they so determine, shall provide for the safe custody of the Seal. The Seal shall only be used by the authority of the Directors and in the presence of a Director or the Secretary or such other person as the Directors may by resolution appoint for this purpose, and every instrument to which the Seal affixed shall be signed by the relevant person. Notwithstanding the above, annual returns and notices filed under the Law may be executed either as a deed or under Seal and in either case without the need for the authority of a resolution of the Directors. 30 Duplicate Seal 132. The Company may maintain in any place or places outside the Cayman Islands a facsimile of any Seal and such facsimile seal shall be affixed in the same way as if it were the Seal. Execution of deeds 133. In accordance with the Law, the Company may execute any deed or other instrument (which would otherwise be required to be executed under Seal) by the signature of such deed or instrument as a deed by a Director or by the Secretary of the Company or by such other person as the Directors may appoint or by any other person or attorney on behalf of the Company appointed by a deed or other instrument executed as a deed by a Director or the Secretary or such other person as aforesaid. DIVIDTerminationS Payment of DividTerminations 134. The Directors may from time to time declare dividTerminations to be paid to the Members according to their rights and interests, including such interim dividTerminations as appear to the Directors to be justified by the position of the Company. The Directors may also pay any fixed cash dividTermination which is payable on any Shares of the Company half yearly or on such other dates, whenever the position of the Company, in the opinion of the Directors, justifies such payment. 135. No dividTermination shall be paid otherwise than out of profits or out of monies otherwise available for dividTermination in accordance with the Law. Calculation of DividTerminations 136. Subject to the rights of Members, if any, entitled to Shares with special rights as to dividTerminations, all dividTerminations shall be declared and paid according to the amount paid up on the Shares in respect of which the dividTermination is paid and any dividTermination on any class of Shares not fully paid shall be declared and paid according to the amounts paid on the Shares of that class, but if and so long as nothing is paid up on any of the Shares in the Company, dividTerminations may be declared and paid according to the number of Shares. No amount paid on a Share in advance of calls shall, while carrying interest, be treated for the purposes of this Article as paid on the Share. DividTerminations may be apportioned and paid pro rata according to the amounts paid-up on the Shares during any portion or portions of the period in respect of which the dividTermination is paid. 31 Deductions 137. The Directors may deduct from any dividTermination, distribution or other monies payable to a Member by the Company on or in respect of any Shares all sums of money (if any) presently payable by him to the Company on account of calls or otherwise in respect of Shares of the Company. Joint Holders 138. If several persons are registered as joint holders of any Share, any of them may give effectual receipts for any dividTermination or other money payable on or in respect of the Share. Payment method 139. Any dividTermination may be paid by cheque or warrant sent through the post to the address of the Member or person entitled thereto in the Register of Members or, in the case of joint holders addressed to the holder whose name stands first in the Register of Members in respect of the Shares at his registered address as appearing on the Register of Members or to such person and such address as the Member or person entitled or such joint holders as the case may be may direct in writing. Every such cheque or warrant shall, unless the holder or joint holders may in writing direct, be made payable to the order of the person to whom it is sent or to the order of the holder or, in the case of joint holders, to the order of the holder whose name stands first in the Register of Members in respect of such Shares, and shall be sent at his or their risk and payment of the cheque or warrant by the bank on which it is drawn shall constitute a good discharge to the Company. Any one of two or more joint holders may give effectual receipts for any dividTerminations, distributions or other monies payable or property distributable in respect of the Shares held by such joint holders. Satisfaction by distribution of specific assets 140. The Directors may declare that any dividTermination or distribution is paid wholly or partly by the distribution of specific assets and, in particular, of paid up shares, debentures or debenture stock of any other company or in any one or more of such ways, and where any difficulty arises in regard to such dividTermination or distribution, the Directors may settle the same as they think expedient, and in particular may issue fractional Shares or ignore fractions altogether and may fix the value for dividTermination or distribution of such specific assets or any part thereof and may determine that cash payments shall be made to any Members upon the basis of the value so fixed in order to secure equality of distribution, and may vest any such specific assets in trustees as may seem expedient to the Directors. 32 No interest 141. No dividTermination or other distribution or other monies payable by the Company on or in respect of any Share shall bear interest against the Company. Unclaimed dividTerminations 142. All unclaimed dividTerminations or distributions may be invested or otherwise made use of by the Directors for the benefit of the Company until claimed. Any dividTermination or distribution unclaimed by a Member six years after the dividTermination or distribution payment date shall be forfeited and revert to the Company. RESERVES 143. The Directors may, before declaring any dividTermination or distribution, set aside such sums as they think proper as a reserve or reserves which shall, at the discretion of the Directors, be applicable for meeting contingencies, or for equalising dividTerminations, or for any other purpose of the Company, and pTerminationing such application may, in their discretion, be employed in the business of the Company or be invested in such manner as the Directors may from time to time think fit. The Directors may also without placing the same to reserve carry forward any sums which they think it prudent not to distribute. CAPITALISATION OF PROFITS Capitalisation 144. The Directors may capitalise any sum standing to the credit of any of the Company’s reserve accounts which are available for distribution (including its Share Premium Account and capital redemption reserve fund, subject to the Law) or any sum standing to the credit of the profit and loss account or otherwise available for distribution and to appropriate such sums to Members in the proportions in which such sum would have been divisible amongst them had the same been a distribution of profits by way of dividTermination and to apply such sum on their behalf in paying up in full unissued Shares for allotment and distribution credited as fully paid-up to and amongst them in the proportion aforesaid. Authorisation 145. Where any difficulty arises in regard to any distribution under the last preceding Article, the Directors may settle the same as they think expedient and, in particular, may authorise any person to sell and Assignment any fractions or may resolve that the distribution should be as nearly as may be practicable in the correct proportion but not exactly so or may ignore fractions altogether, and may determine that cash payments should be made to any Members in order to adjust the rights of all parties, as may seem expedient to the Directors. The Directors may appoint any person to sign on behalf of the persons entitled to participate in the distribution any contract necessary or desirable for giving effect thereto and such appointment shall be effective and binding upon the Members. 33 SHARE PREMIUM ACCOUNT 146. The Directors shall in accordance with the Law establish a Share Premium Account and shall carry to the credit of such account from time to time a sum equal to the amount or value of the premium paid on the issue of any Share. 147. There shall be debited to any Share Premium Account on the redemption or purchase of a Share the difference between the nominal value of such Share and the redemption or purchase price provided always that at the discretion of the Directors such sum may be paid out of the profits of the Company or, if permitted by the Law, out of capital. ACCOUNTING RECORDS Books of account 148. The Directors shall cause to be kept accounting records sufficient to give a true and fair view of the state of the Company's affairs and to show and explain its transactions and otherwise in accordance with the Law. Inspection by Members 149. The accounting records shall be kept at the Registered Office or at such other place or places as the Directors think fit, and shall at all times be open to inspection by the Directors. No Member (who is not also a Director) shall have any right to inspect any accounting record or book or document of the Company except as conferred by law or authorised by the Directors or by the Members by Ordinary Resolution. Records and audit 150. From time to time the Company in general meeting may determine (or revoke, alter or amTermination any such determination) or, failing such determination, the Directors may determine (or revoke, alter or amTermination any such determination): 150.1 that the accounts of the Company be audited and the appointment of the Auditors; 150.2 that there be prepared and sent to each Member and other person entitled thereto a profit and loss account, a balance sheet, group accounts and/or reports for such period and on such terms as they may determine; and 150.3 that there be laid before the Company in general meeting a copy of every balance sheet together with a copy of the Auditor's report. 34 SERVICE OF NOTICES AND DOCUMENTS Form and delivery of notices 151. Notices or other documents or communications may be given to any Member by the Company either personally or by sTerminationing it by courier, post, fax or email to him to his registered address, or (if he has no registered address) to the address, if any, supplied by him to the Company for the giving of notices to him. Any notice shall be deemed to be effected: 151.1 if delivered personally or sent by courier, by properly addressing and prepaying a letter containing the notice; and to have been effected, in the case of a notice of a meeting, when delivered; 151.2 if sent by post, by properly addressing, prepaying, and posting a letter containing the notice (by airmail if available) and to have been effected, in the case of a notice of a meeting, at the Termination of three days after it was posted; and 151.3 if sent by fax or email by properly addressing and sTerminationing such notice through the appropriate transmitting medium and to have been effected on the day the same is sent. 152. A notice may be given by the Company to the joint holders of a Share by giving the notice to the joint holder named first in the Register of Members in respect of the Share. 153. A notice may be given by the Company to the person entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a Member by sTerminationing it through the post in a prepaid letter addressed to them by name, or by the title of representatives of the deceased, or trustee of the bankrupt, or by any like description, at the address, if any, supplied for the purpose by the persons claiming to be so entitled, or (until such an address has been so supplied) by giving the notice in any manner in which the same might have been given if the death or bankruptcy had not occurred. 154. Notice of every general meeting shall be given in any manner hereinbefore authorised to: 154.1 every Member entitled to vote except those Members entitled to vote who (having no registered address) have not supplied to the Company an address for the giving of notices to them; and 154.2 every person entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a Member, who, but for his death or bankruptcy would be entitled to receive notice of the meeting. 155. No other persons shall be entitled to receive notices of general meeting. 35 WINDING UP Method of winding up 156. Subject to the rights attaching to any Shares, if the Company shall be wound up, the liquidator may, with the sanction of a Special Resolution and any other sanction required by the Law or these Articles, divide amongst the Members in kind the whole or any part of the assets of the Company (whether they shall consist of property of the same kind or not) and may for such purpose set such value as he deems fair upon any property to be divided as aforesaid and may determine how such division shall be carried out as between the Members or different classes of Members. The liquidator may, with the like sanction, vest the whole or any part of such assets in trustees upon such trusts for the benefit of the contributories as the liquidator, with the like sanction, shall think fit, but so that no Member shall be compelled to accept any asset upon which there is any liability. Distribution of assets 157. If the Company shall be wound up and the assets available for distribution amongst the Members as such shall be insufficient to repay the whole of the paid up capital, such assets shall be distributed so that, as nearly as may be, the losses shall be borne by the Members in proportion to the capital paid up, or which ought to have been paid up, at the commencement of the winding up, on the Shares held by them respectively. And if in a winding up the assets available for distribution amongst the Members shall be more than sufficient to repay the whole of the capital paid up at the commencement of the winding up, the excess shall be distributed amongst the Members in proportion to the capital paid up at the commencement of the winding up on the Shares held by them respectively. This Article is to be without prejudice to the rights of the holders of Shares issued upon special terms and conditions. Indemnification Indemnification and limitation of liability 158. Every Indemnified Person shall, in the absence of wilful neglect or default, be indemnified and held harmless out of the assets of the Company against all liabilities, loss, damage, cost or expense (including but not limited to liabilities under contract, tort and statute or any applicable foreign law or regulation and all reasonable legal and other costs and expenses on a full Indemnification basis properly payable) incurred or suffered by him by or by reason of any act done, conceived in or omitted in the conduct of the Company’s business or in the discharge of his duties and the Indemnification contained in this Article shall extTermination to any Indemnified Person acting in any office or trust in the reasonable belief that he has been appointed or elected to such office or trust notwithstanding any defect in such appointment or election. 36 159. No Indemnified Person shall be liable to the Company for acts, defaults or omissions of any other Indemnified Person. Indemnification and reimbursement 160. Every Indemnified Person shall be indemnified out of the funds of the Company against all liabilities incurred by him by or by reason of any act done, conceived in or omitted in the conduct of the Company’s business or in the discharge of his duties in defTerminationing any proceedings, whether civil or criminal, in which judgment is given in his favour, or in which he is acquitted, or in connection with any application in which relief from liability is granted to him by the court. 161. To the extent that any Indemnified Person is entitled to claim an Indemnification pursuant to these Articles in respect of amounts paid or discharged by him, the relative Indemnification shall take effect as an obligation of the Company to reimburse the person making such payment or effecting such discharge. Wilful neglect or default 162. Each Member and the Company agree to waive any claim or right of action he or it may at any time have, whether individually or by or in the right of the Company, against any Indemnified Person on account of any act or omission of such Indemnified Person in the performance of his duties for the Company; provided however, that such waiver shall not apply to any claims or rights of action arising out of the wilful neglect or default of such Indemnified Person or to recover any gain, personal profit or advantage to which such Indemnified Person is not legally entitled. Advance of legal fees 163. Expenses incurred in defTerminationing any civil or criminal action or proceeding for which indemnification is required pursuant to these Articles shall be paid by the Company in advance of the final disposition of such action or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnified Person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that the Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified pursuant to these Articles. Each Member of the Company shall be deemed to have acknowledged and agreed that the advances of funds may be made by the Company as aforesaid, and when made by the Company under this Article are made to meet expTerminationitures incurred for the purpose of enabling such Indemnified Person to properly perform his or her duties to the Company. 37 CONTINUATION 164. The Company shall have the power, subject to the provisions of the Law and with the approval of a Special Resolution, to continue as a body incorporated under the laws of any jurisdiction outside of the Cayman Islands and to be de-registered in the Cayman Islands. AMTerminationMENT OF MEMORANDUM AND ARTICLES Subject to the provisions of the Law, the Company may from time to time by Special Resolution alter or amTermination the Memorandum or these Articles in whole or in part provided that no such amTerminationment shall affect the special rights attaching to any class of Shares without the consent or sanction provided for in these Articles. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Memorandum or in these Articles or in Law, for so long as HLNG is a Member, the Company shall not alter or amTermination the Memorandum or these Articles in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of HLNG 38 SCHEDULE A INSURANCE POLICIES Hull & Material Adverse Effecthinery insurance: All insurances carried, or to be carried, by the owner of the Vessel are placed as part of Höegh LNG’s fleet placements in the international insurance markets.

Replacement Share Certificates 15.

The instrument of Assignment of any Share shall be executed by or on behalf of the Assignmentor (and, if the Directors so determine, the Assignmentee).

Subject to any applicable restrictions contained in these Articles, Shares shall be Assignmentred in any usual or common form approved by the Directors. Refusal to register Assignments 18. The Directors may, in their absolute discretion and without assigning any reason therefore, decline to register any Assignment of any Share.

If the Directors decline to register a Assignment of Shares they shall sTermination notice of the refusal to the Assignmentee within one month after the date on which the Assignment was lodged with the Company. 20. The Directors may also suspTermination the registration of the Assignments at such times and for such periods as the Directors may from time to time determine. TRANSMISSION OF SHARES Transmission of Shares 21. If a Member dies, the survivor or survivors (where he was a joint holder), and the legal personal representative (where he was sole holder), shall be the only person recognised by the Company as having any title to the Share. The estate of a deceased Member is not thereby released from any liability in respect of any Share held by him, whether solely or jointly. For the purpose of this Article, legal personal representative means the person to whom probate or letters of administration has or have been granted in the Cayman Islands or, if there is no such person, such other person as the Directors may in their absolute discretion determine to be the person recognised by the Company for the purpose of this Article. Election by persons entitled on transmission 22. Any person becoming entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a Member or otherwise by operation of Governing Law may elect, upon such evidence being produced as may be required by the Directors as to his entitlement, either be registered himself as a Member in respect of the Share or, instead of being registered himself, to make such Assignment of the Share as the deceased or bankrupt Member could have made. 7 Manner of election 23. If the person so becoming entitled elects to be registered himself, he shall deliver or sTermination to the Company a notice in writing signed by him stating that he so elects. If he shall elect to Assignment the Shares, he shall signify his election by signing an instrument of Assignment of such Shares in favour of his Assignmentee. All the limitations, restrictions and provisions of these Articles relating to the right to Assignment and the registration of Assignments of Shares shall be applicable to any such notice or instrument of Assignment as aforesaid as if the death of the Member or other event giving rise to the transmission had not occurred and the notice or instrument of Assignment was an instrument of Assignment signed by such Member. Rights of persons entitled on transmission 24. A person becoming entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of the Member (or otherwise by operation of Governing Law), upon such evidence being produced as may be required by the Directors as to his entitlement, shall be entitled to the same dividTerminations and other monies payable in respect of the Share as he would be entitled if he were the holder of such Share. However, he shall not be entitled, until he becomes registered as the holder of such Share, to receive notices of or to attTermination or vote at general meetings of the Company or (except as aforesaid) to exercise any other rights or privileges of a Member. The Directors may at any time give notice requiring such person to elect either to be registered himself or to Assignment the Share and, if the notice is not complied with within sixty days, the Directors may thereafter withhold payment of all dividTerminations and other monies payable in respect of the Shares until the requirements of the notice have been complied with. REDEMPTION AND PURCHASE OF SHARES 25. Subject to the provisions of the Law and the Memorandum, the Company may: 25.1 purchase its own Shares (including any redeemable Shares) in such manner and on such terms as the Directors may agree with the relevant Member unless following such purchase there would no longer be any issued Shares and may make payment for such purchase or for any redemption of Shares in any manner authorised by the Law, including out of capital; and 25.2 reduce its share capital and any capital redemption reserve fund in any manner whatsoever. 8 VARIATION OF SHARE RIGHTS Variation of class rights 26. If at any time the share capital is divided into different classes of Shares, all or any of the special rights attached to any class of Shares (unless otherwise provided by the terms of issue of the Shares of that class) may be varied or abrogated with the consent in writing of the holders of not less than two thirds of the issued Shares of that class or with the sanction of a resolution passed by the holders of not less than two thirds of the issued Shares of that class as may be present in person or by proxy at a separate general meeting of the holders of the Shares of that class. To any such separate general meeting, all of the provisions of these Articles relating to general meetings shall mutatis mutandis apply, but so that the necessary quorum shall be any one or more persons holding or representing by proxy not less than one third of the issued Shares of the class and that any holder of Shares of the relevant class present in person or by proxy may demand a poll. Treatment of classes 27. For the purpose of a separate class meeting, the Directors may treat two or more of all classes of Shares as forming one class if they consider that such class of Shares would be affected in the same way by the proposals under consideration. Effect of Share issue on class rights 28. The rights conferred upon the holders of any Shares shall not, unless otherwise expressly provided in the rights attaching to such Shares, be deemed to be altered by the creation or issue of further Shares ranking pari passu therewith. NON-RECOGNITION OF TRUSTS 29. Except as required by the Law or these Articles, or under an order of a court of competent jurisdiction, the Company shall not be bound by or compelled to recognise in any way, even when notice thereof is given to it, any equitable, contingent, future or partial interest in any Share, or any other rights in respect of any Share other than an absolute right to the entirety thereof in the registered holder. 9 LIEN Lien generally 30. The Company shall have a first and paramount lien on every Share (not being a fully paid Share) for all moneys (whether presently payable or not) called or payable at a date fixed by or in accordance with the terms of issue of such Share in respect of that Share, and the Company shall also have a first and paramount lien on every Share (other than a fully paid up Share) standing registered in the name of a Member, whether singly or jointly with any other person for all debts and liabilities of a Member or his estate to the Company, whether the same shall have been incurred before or after notice to the Company of any interest of any person other than such Member, and whether the time for the payment or discharge of the same shall have actually arrived or not, and notwithstanding that the same are joint debts or liabilities of such Member or his estate and any other person, whether a Member or not. The Directors may at any time, either generally or in any particular case, waive any lien that has arisen or declare any Share to be wholly or in part exempt from the provisions of this Article. The Company's lien, if any, on a Share shall extTermination to all dividTerminations payable thereon. Enforcement 31. The Company may sell, in such manner as the Directors think fit, any Share on which the Company has a lien, provided a sum in respect of which the lien exists is presently payable, and is not paid within fourteen days after a notice in writing has been given to the registered holder  for the time being of the Share, demanding payment of the sum presently payable and giving notice of the intention to sell in default of such payment. Completion of sale 32. For giving effect to any such sale, the Directors may authorise any person to Assignment the Share sold to the purchaser thereof. The purchaser shall be registered as the holder of the Share comprised in any such Assignment and he shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money, nor shall his title to the Share be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings relating to the sale. Application of proceeds 33. The net proceeds of such sale shall be applied in payment or discharge of the debt or liability in respect of which the lien exists and as is presently payable, and any balance shall (subject to a like lien for debts or liabilities not presently payable as existed upon the Shares prior to the sale) be paid to the person who was the registered holder of the Share immediately before such sale. CALLS ON SHARES Calls on Shares generally 34. The Directors may from time to time make calls upon the Members in respect of any moneys unpaid on their Shares (whether in respect of the par value of the Shares or premium or otherwise and not, by the terms of issue thereof, made payable at a future date fixed by or in accordance with such terms of issue); and each Member shall (subject to the Company serving upon him at least 14 days’ notice specifying the time or times and place of payment) pay to the Company at the time or times and place so specified the amount called on his Shares. A call may be revoked or postponed by the Directors wholly or in part as the Directors may determine. A call shall be deemed to have been made at the time when the resolution of the Directors authorising the call was passed. 10 Payment 35. Payment of a call may be made by instalments on the direction of the Directors. 36. If a sum called in respect of a Share is not paid before or on the day appointed for payment thereof, the person from whom the sum is due shall pay interest on the sum from the day payment is due to the time of the actual payment at such rate as the Directors may determine, but the Directors may waive payment of such interest wholly or in part. 37. Any sum payable in respect of a Share on issue or allotment or at any fixed date, whether in respect of the par value of the Share or premium or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a call and if it is not paid all the relevant provisions as to payment of interest, forfeiture or otherwise of these Articles shall apply as if such sum had become due and payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified. 38. The Directors may issue Shares with different terms as to the amount and times of payment of calls. Liability of joint holders 39. The joint holders of a Share shall be jointly and severally liable to pay calls in respect thereof. Interest 40. The Directors may, if they think fit, receive from any Member willing to advance the same, all or any part of the moneys uncalled and unpaid upon any Shares held by him; and may (until the amount would otherwise become payable) pay interest at such rate (not exceeding six per cent without the sanction of the Company in general meeting) as may be agreed upon between the Member paying the sum in advance and the Directors. FORFEITURE OF SHARES Notice 41. If a Member fails to pay any call or instalment of a call by the date it becomes due and payable, the Directors may, at any time thereafter while such call or instalment remains unpaid, give notice to the Member requiring payment of the unpaid portion of the call or instalment, together with any accrued interest and expenses incurred by the Company by reason of such non-payment. 11 42. The notice shall specify where and by what date (not being less than the Termination of 14 days’ from the date of the notice) payment is to be made and shall state that if it is not complied with the Shares in respect of which the call was made will be liable to be forfeited. The Directors may accept the surrTerminationer of any Share liable to be forfeited hereunder and, in such case, references to these Articles to forfeiture shall include surrTerminationer. Forfeiture for non-compliance 43. If such notice is not complied with, any Share in respect of which the notice was given may thereafter, before the payment of all calls or instalments and interest due in respect thereof has been made, be forfeited by a resolution of the Directors. Such forfeiture shall include all dividTerminations declared, other distributions or other monies payable in respect of the forfeited Shares and not paid before the forfeiture. Forfeited Shares 44. A forfeited Share may be sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed of upon such terms and in such manner as the Directors shall think fit, and at any time before a sale, re-allotment or disposition, the forfeiture may be cancelled on such terms as the Directors think fit. Continued liability for forfeited Member 45. A person whose Shares have been forfeited shall cease to be a Member in respect of the forfeited Shares, but shall remain liable to pay to the Company all moneys which at the date of forfeiture were presently payable by him in respect of the Shares together with interest at such rate as the Directors may determine from the date of forfeiture until payment, but his liability shall cease if and when the Company receives payment in full of all amounts due in respect of the Shares. The Company may enforce payment without being under any obligation to make any allowance for the value of the Shares forfeited. Evidence of forfeiture 46. An affidavit in writing by a Director or Secretary of the Company that a Share has been duly forfeited on a specified date, shall be conclusive evidence of the facts stated in it as against all persons claiming to be entitled to the Share. The Company may receive the consideration, if any, given for the Share on any sale, re-allotment or disposition thereof and may authorise some person to execute a Assignment of the Share in favour of the person to whom the Share is sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed of, and he shall thereupon be registered as the holder of the Share, and shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money (if any) nor shall his title to the Share be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings in reference to the forfeiture, sale, re-allotment or disposition of the Share. 12 47. The provisions of these Articles as to forfeiture shall apply in the case of non-payment of any sum which, by the terms of issue of a Share, becomes payable at a fixed time, whether on account of the par value of the Share, or by way of premium or otherwise, as if the same had been made payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified to the Member. INCREASE OF CAPITAL 48. The Company may from time to time by Ordinary Resolution increase its share capital by such sum, to be divided into new Shares of such par value, and with such rights, priorities and privileges attached thereto as the resolution shall prescribe. 49. Subject to any directions given by the Company in a general meeting, all new Shares shall be at the disposal of the Directors in accordance with these Articles. 50. The new Shares shall be subject to the same provisions of these Articles with reference to the payment of calls, lien, forfeiture, Assignment, transmission and otherwise, as the Shares in the original share capital. ALTERATION OF CAPITAL 51. The Company may from time to time by Ordinary Resolution: 51.1 consolidate and divide all or any of its share capital into Shares of larger par value than its existing Shares; 51.2 sub divide its existing Shares, or any of them, into Shares of smaller par value than is fixed by the Memorandum, subject nevertheless to the provisions of section 13 of the Law; 51.3 cancel any Shares which, at the date of the passing of the resolution, have not been taken or agreed to be taken by any person; and 51.4 convert all or any paid up Shares into stock, and reconvert all or any stock into paid up Shares of any denomination. 52. The Company may from time to time by Special Resolution: 52.1 divide its Shares into several classes and attach to such classes any preferential, deferred, or special rights or restrictions in accordance with these Articles; 52.2 change the currency denomination of its share capital; 13 52.3 reduce its share capital and any capital redemption reserve fund in any manner whatsoever; and 52.4 merge or consolidate with any one or more constituent companies (as defined in the Law).

If at any time there are not sufficient Directors capable of acting to form a quorum, any Director, or any one or more Members holding in the aggregate not less than one third of the total issued share capital of the Company entitled to vote, may convene an extraordinary general meeting in the same manner as nearly as possible as that in which meetings may be convened by the Directors. Members’ requisition 54. The Directors shall, upon the requisition in writing of one or more Members holding in the aggregate not less than one tenth of such paid up capital of the Company as at the date of the requisition carries the right of voting at general meetings, convene an extraordinary general meeting. Any such requisition shall express the object of the meeting proposed to be called, and must be signed by the requisitionists and deposited at the Registered Office, and may consist of several documents in like form, each signed by one or more requisitionists. 55.

Every notice shall specify the place, the day and the time of meeting and, in the case of special business, the general nature of the business to be conducted at the general meeting, and shall be given in the manner provided in these Articles or in such other manner (if any) as may be prescribed by the Company, to such persons as are entitled to receive such notices from the Company. A general meeting may be convened by such shorter notice, or without notice, by a majority in number of the Members having the right to attTermination and vote at the meeting, being a majority together holding not less than ninety-five percent in nominal value of the Shares giving that right. 14 Omission or non-receipt 57.

No business shall be transacted at any general meeting unless a quorum of Members is present at the time that the meeting proceeds to business, but the absence of a quorum shall not preclude the appointment, choice or election of a chairman, which shall not be treated as part of the business of the Meeting. Save as herein otherwise provided, one or more Members holding in the aggregate not less than one third of the total issued share capital of the Company present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall be a quorum.

In any other case, it shall stand adjourned to the same day in the next week, at the same time and place, and if at the adjourned meeting a quorum is not present within half an hour from the time appointed for the meeting, the Members present shall be a quorum. Meeting by telephone or other facilities 61. A meeting of the Members may be held by telephone, electronic or other communication facilities (including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, by telephone or video conferencing) by which all persons participating in the meeting can communicate with each other simultaneously and instantaneously, and participation in such a general meeting shall constitute presence in person at such meeting. 62. Any Director shall be entitled to attTermination and speak at any general meeting of the Company. 15 Appointment of chairman 63. The chairman (if any) of the Board of Directors shall preside as chairman at every general meeting of the Company.

If no Director is present, or if each of the Directors present declines to take the chair, the Members present and entitled to vote shall elect one of their number to be chairman. Adjournment of meeting 64. The chairman may, with the consent of a meeting at which a quorum is present (and shall if so directed by the meeting) adjourn the meeting from time to time and from place to place, but no business shall be transacted at any adjourned meeting other than the business left unfinished at the meeting from which the adjournment took place. When a meeting is adjourned for ten days or more, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given as in the case of an original meeting. Save as aforesaid, it shall not be necessary to give any notice of an adjournment or of the business to be transacted at an adjourned meeting. VOTING Ordinary Resolution Save where a Special Resolution or other greater majority is required by the Law or these Articles, any question proposed for consideration at any general meeting shall be decided by an Ordinary Resolution. Voting on a show of hands 65. At any general meeting, a resolution put to the vote of the meeting shall be decided on a show of hands, unless before or on the declaration of the result of the show of hands, or on the withdrawal of any other demand for a poll. Demand for poll 66. A poll is demanded by: 66.1 the chairman of the meeting; or 66.2 at least three Members present in person or by proxy; or 66.3 any Member or Members present in person or by proxy and holding collectively not less than one tenth of the total voting rights of all the Members having the right to vote at such meeting; or 16 66.4 a Member or Members present in person or by proxy holding Shares conferring the right to vote at such meeting, being Shares on which an aggregate sum has been paid up equal to not less than one tenth of the total sum paid up on all such Shares conferring such right. 67. Unless a poll is duly demanded and the demand is not withdrawn, a declaration by the chairman that a resolution has, on a show of hands, been carried or carried unanimously, or by a particular majority, or lost and an entry to that effect in the minutes of the proceedings of the Company shall be conclusive evidence of that fact, without proof of the number or proportion of the votes recorded in favour of, or against, that resolution. The demand for a poll may be withdrawn by the person or any persons making it at any time prior to the declaration of the result of the poll. 68. If a poll is duly demanded, it shall be taken in such manner as the chairman directs, and the result of the poll shall be deemed to be the resolution of the meeting at which the poll was demanded. 69. In the case of an equality of votes at a general meeting, whether on a show of hands or on a poll, the chairman of the meeting at which the show of hands takes place or at which the poll is demanded, shall not be entitled to a second or casting vote and the resolution shall fail. 70. A poll demanded on the election of a chairman or on a question of adjournment shall be taken forthwith. A poll demanded on any other question shall be taken in such manner and either forthwith or at such time later in the meeting as the chairman of the meeting shall direct. 71. The demand for a poll shall not prevent the continuance of a meeting for the transaction of any business other than the question on which the poll has been demanded and it may be withdrawn at any time before the close of the meeting or the taking of the poll, whichever is the earlier. Voting on a poll 72. On a poll votes may be cast either personally or by proxy. 73. A person entitled to more than one vote on a poll need not use all his votes or cast all the votes he uses in the same way. 74. On a show of hands, every Member present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall have one vote. On a poll, every Member present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall have one vote for each Share of which he is the registered holder. 17 75. In the case of joint holders of a Share, the vote of the senior who tTerminationers a vote, whether in person or by proxy, shall be accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint holders; and for this purpose seniority shall be determined by the order in which the names stand in the Register of Members in respect of the joint holding. 76. A Member of unsound mind, or, in respect of whom an order has been made by any court having jurisdiction in lunacy, may vote, whether on a show of hands or on a poll, by his receiver, committee, curator bonis or other person of similar nature appointed by such court, and any such receiver, committee, curator bonis or other person may vote by proxy and may otherwise act and be treated as such Member for the purpose of the general meetings. 77. No Member, unless the Directors otherwise determine, shall be entitled to vote at any general meeting, unless all calls or other sums presently payable by him in respect of Shares in the Company have been paid. 78. No objection shall be raised as to the qualification of any voter or as to whether any votes have been properly counted except at the general meeting or adjourned general meeting at which the vote objected to is given or tTerminationered and every vote not disallowed at the meeting shall be valid. Any objection made in due time and in accordance with these Articles shall be referred to the chairman whose decision shall be final and conclusive. Shareholder Restricted Matters 78A.

The continuing Directors may act notwithstanding any vacancy in their body, but, if and so long as their number is reduced below the number fixed by or pursuant to these Articles as the necessary quorum of Directors, the continuing Directors may act for the purpose of increasing the number of Directors to that number, or of summoning a general meeting of the Company, but for no other purpose. 25 Chairman 108. The Directors may elect a chairman of their meetings and determine the period for which he is to hold office; but if no such chairman is elected, or if at any meeting the chairman is not present within five minutes after the time appointed for holding the same, the Directors present may choose one of their number to be chairman of the meeting. Written resolutions of Directors 109. A resolution in writing signed by all of the Directors or all of the members of a committee of Directors for the time being entitled to receive notice of a meeting of the Directors (or by an alternate Director as provided in these Articles), including a resolution signed in counterpart and/or sent or evidenced by way of signed fax or electronic transmission, shall be as valid and effectual as if it had been passed at a meeting of the Directors or of a committee of Directors duly called and constituted. Meeting by telephone or other facilities 110. To the extent permitted by law, a meeting of the Directors or a committee appointed by the Directors may be held by means of such telephone, electronic or other communication facilities (including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, by telephone or by video conferencing) as permit all persons participating in the meeting to communicate with each other simultaneously and instantaneously and participation in such a meeting shall constitute presence in person at such meeting. Such a meeting shall be deemed to take place where the largest group of those Directors participating in the meeting is physically assembled, or, if there is no such group, where the chairman of the meeting then is. Validity of acts in spite of defect 111. All acts done by any meeting of the Directors or of a committee of Directors, or by any person acting as a Director shall, notwithstanding that it be afterwards discovered that there was some defect in the appointment of any such Director or person acting as aforesaid, or that they or any of them were disqualified, be as valid as if every such person had been duly appointed and was qualified to be a Director. Minutes 112. The Directors shall cause minutes to be made and records kept for the purpose of recording: 26 112.1 all appointments of officers made by the Directors; 112.2 the names of the Directors and other persons present at each meeting of the Directors and of any committee of the Directors; and 112.3 all resolutions and proceedings at all meetings of the Members of the Company or any class of Members and of the Directors and of committees of Directors; and the chairman of all such meetings or of any meeting confirming the minutes thereof shall sign the same. DIRECTORS’ INTERESTS 113. A Director may hold any other office or place of profit with the Company (except that of Auditor) in conjunction with his office of Director for such period and upon such terms as to remuneration and otherwise as the Directors may determine. 114. A Director or officer may act by himself or his firm in a professional capacity for the Company (otherwise than as Auditor), and he or his firm shall be entitled to remuneration for professional services as if he were not a Director or officer. 115. No Director or officer shall be disqualified from his office or prevented by such office from holding any office or place of profit under the Company or under any company in which the Company shall be a Member or have any interest, or from contracting with the Company, either as vTerminationor, purchaser or otherwise, nor shall any such contract or any contract or transaction entered into by or on behalf of the Company in which any Director or officer shall be in any way interested be or be liable to be avoided nor shall any Director or officer so contracting, dealing or being so interested be liable to account to the Company for any profit realised by any such contract or transaction by reason of such Director holding office or of the fiduciary relation thereby established. Disclosure and nature of interest 116. A Director (or his alternate Director in his absence) shall be at liberty to vote in respect of any contract or transaction in which he is interested provided that the nature of the interest of the Director in any such contract or transaction shall be disclosed by him at or prior to its consideration and any vote thereon. 117. The nature of the interest of any Director or officer in any contract, dealing or transacting with or affecting the Company shall be disclosed by him at or prior to its consideration and any vote thereon and a general notice that a Director or officer is a shareholder of any specified firm or company and/or is to be regarded as interested in any transaction with such firm or company shall be sufficient disclosure hereunder and after such general notice it shall not be necessary to give special notice relating to any particular transaction. 27 DELEGATION OF DIRECTORS’ POWERS Power to delegate 118. Directors may from time to time and at any time by power of attorney or otherwise appoint any company, firm or person or fluctuating body of persons, whether nominated directly or indirectly by the Directors, to be the attorney or attorneys of the Company for such purposes and with such powers, authorities and discretions (not exceeding those vested in or exercisable by the Directors under these Articles) and for such period and subject to such conditions as they may think fit, and any such power of attorney may contain such provisions for the protection and convenience of persons dealing with any such attorney and of such attorney as the Directors may think fit and may also authorise any such attorney to delegate all or any of the powers, authorities and discretions vested in him. 119. The Directors may delegate any of the powers exercisable by them to a Managing Director , Director or any other person or persons acting individually or jointly as they may from time to time by resolution appoint upon such terms and conditions and with such restrictions as they may think fit, and may from time to time by resolution revoke, withdraw, alter or vary all or any such powers. Alternate Directors 120. Any Director may by writing appoint any other Director, or other person willing to act, to be his alternate and remove his alternate so appointed by him. Such appointment or removal shall be by notice to the Registered Office signed by the Director making or revoking the appointment or in any other manner approved by the Directors, and shall be effective on the date the notice is served and the alternate shall be notified of such appointment or revocation. Subject to the removal by the appointing Director, the alternate shall continue in office until the date on which his appointor ceases to be a Director. An alternate may also be a Director in his own right and may act as alternate to more than one Director. 121. An alternate shall be entitled to receive notice of all meetings of the Directors, attTermination, be counted in the quorum, vote and act in such appointor’s place at every such meeting at which the appointing Director is not personally present, and generally to perform all the functions of his appointor as a Director in his absence. 122. These Articles (except as regards powers to appoint an alternate and remuneration) apply equally to the alternate as though he were the Director in his own right. 123. An alternate Director shall be deemed for all purposes to be a Director and shall alone be responsible for his own acts and defaults and shall not be deemed to be the agent of the Director appointing him. The signature of an alternate to any resolution in writing of the Director or a committee there shall, unless the terms of the appointment provides to the contrary, be as effective as the signature of the Director or Directors to whom he is alternate. 28 Committees of Directors 124. The Directors may delegate any of their powers to committees consisting of such member or members of their body as they think fit; any committee so formed shall, in the exercise of the powers so delegated, conform to any regulations that may be imposed on it by the Directors. 125. A committee may elect a chairman of its meetings; if no such chairman is elected, or if at any meeting the chairman is not present within five minutes after the time appointed for holding the same, the members present may choose one of their number to be chairman of the meeting. 126. A committee may meet and adjourn as it thinks proper. Questions arising at any meeting shall be determined by a majority of votes of the members present and in case of an equality of votes the chairman shall not have a second or casting vote and the motion shall be deemed to have been lost. Officers 127. The Directors may appoint a Secretary and such other officers as they may from time to time consider necessary upon such terms as to duration of office, remuneration and otherwise as they may think fit. Such Secretary or other officers need not be Directors and in the case of the other officers may be ascribed such titles as the Directors may decide and the Directors may revoke or terminate any such election or appointment. Any such revocation or termination shall be without prejudice to any claim for any damages that such officer may have against the Company or the Company may have against such officer for any breach of any contract of service between him and the Company which may be involved in such revocation or termination. Save as provided in the Law or these Articles, the powers and duties of the officers of the Company shall be such (if any) as are determined from time to time by the Directors. DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION Remuneration 128. The remuneration to be paid to the Directors, if any, shall be determined by the Company in general meeting or, in the absence of such a determination, by the Directors. Expenses 129. Each Director shall also be entitled to be paid his reasonable travelling, hotel and other expenses properly incurred by him in connection with his attTerminationance at meetings of the Directors, committees of the Directors or general meetings of the Company, or otherwise in connection with the business of the Company, or to receive a fixed allowance in respect thereof as may be determined by the Directors, or a combination partly of one such method and partly the other. 29 Additional remuneration 130. The Directors may by resolution approve additional remuneration to any Director for services which in the opinion of the Directors go beyond the ordinary duties of a Director, and such extra remuneration shall be in addition to any remuneration provided for, by or pursuant to any other Article. SEALS AND DEEDS Use of Seal 131. The Directors may determine that the Company shall have a Seal, and if they so determine, shall provide for the safe custody of the Seal. The Seal shall only be used by the authority of the Directors and in the presence of a Director or the Secretary or such other person as the Directors may by resolution appoint for this purpose, and every instrument to which the Seal affixed shall be signed by the relevant person. Notwithstanding the above, annual returns and notices filed under the Law may be executed either as a deed or under Seal and in either case without the need for the authority of a resolution of the Directors. 30 Duplicate Seal 132. The Company may maintain in any place or places outside the Cayman Islands a facsimile of any Seal and such facsimile seal shall be affixed in the same way as if it were the Seal. Execution of deeds 133. In accordance with the Law, the Company may execute any deed or other instrument (which would otherwise be required to be executed under Seal) by the signature of such deed or instrument as a deed by a Director or by the Secretary of the Company or by such other person as the Directors may appoint or by any other person or attorney on behalf of the Company appointed by a deed or other instrument executed as a deed by a Director or the Secretary or such other person as aforesaid. DIVIDTerminationS Payment of DividTerminations 134. The Directors may from time to time declare dividTerminations to be paid to the Members according to their rights and interests, including such interim dividTerminations as appear to the Directors to be justified by the position of the Company. The Directors may also pay any fixed cash dividTermination which is payable on any Shares of the Company half yearly or on such other dates, whenever the position of the Company, in the opinion of the Directors, justifies such payment. 135. No dividTermination shall be paid otherwise than out of profits or out of monies otherwise available for dividTermination in accordance with the Law. Calculation of DividTerminations 136. Subject to the rights of Members, if any, entitled to Shares with special rights as to dividTerminations, all dividTerminations shall be declared and paid according to the amount paid up on the Shares in respect of which the dividTermination is paid and any dividTermination on any class of Shares not fully paid shall be declared and paid according to the amounts paid on the Shares of that class, but if and so long as nothing is paid up on any of the Shares in the Company, dividTerminations may be declared and paid according to the number of Shares. No amount paid on a Share in advance of calls shall, while carrying interest, be treated for the purposes of this Article as paid on the Share. DividTerminations may be apportioned and paid pro rata according to the amounts paid-up on the Shares during any portion or portions of the period in respect of which the dividTermination is paid. 31 Deductions 137. The Directors may deduct from any dividTermination, distribution or other monies payable to a Member by the Company on or in respect of any Shares all sums of money (if any) presently payable by him to the Company on account of calls or otherwise in respect of Shares of the Company. Joint Holders 138. If several persons are registered as joint holders of any Share, any of them may give effectual receipts for any dividTermination or other money payable on or in respect of the Share. Payment method 139. Any dividTermination may be paid by cheque or warrant sent through the post to the address of the Member or person entitled thereto in the Register of Members or, in the case of joint holders addressed to the holder whose name stands first in the Register of Members in respect of the Shares at his registered address as appearing on the Register of Members or to such person and such address as the Member or person entitled or such joint holders as the case may be may direct in writing. Every such cheque or warrant shall, unless the holder or joint holders may in writing direct, be made payable to the order of the person to whom it is sent or to the order of the holder or, in the case of joint holders, to the order of the holder whose name stands first in the Register of Members in respect of such Shares, and shall be sent at his or their risk and payment of the cheque or warrant by the bank on which it is drawn shall constitute a good discharge to the Company. Any one of two or more joint holders may give effectual receipts for any dividTerminations, distributions or other monies payable or property distributable in respect of the Shares held by such joint holders. Satisfaction by distribution of specific assets 140. The Directors may declare that any dividTermination or distribution is paid wholly or partly by the distribution of specific assets and, in particular, of paid up shares, debentures or debenture stock of any other company or in any one or more of such ways, and where any difficulty arises in regard to such dividTermination or distribution, the Directors may settle the same as they think expedient, and in particular may issue fractional Shares or ignore fractions altogether and may fix the value for dividTermination or distribution of such specific assets or any part thereof and may determine that cash payments shall be made to any Members upon the basis of the value so fixed in order to secure equality of distribution, and may vest any such specific assets in trustees as may seem expedient to the Directors. 32 No interest 141. No dividTermination or other distribution or other monies payable by the Company on or in respect of any Share shall bear interest against the Company. Unclaimed dividTerminations 142. All unclaimed dividTerminations or distributions may be invested or otherwise made use of by the Directors for the benefit of the Company until claimed. Any dividTermination or distribution unclaimed by a Member six years after the dividTermination or distribution payment date shall be forfeited and revert to the Company. RESERVES 143. The Directors may, before declaring any dividTermination or distribution, set aside such sums as they think proper as a reserve or reserves which shall, at the discretion of the Directors, be applicable for meeting contingencies, or for equalising dividTerminations, or for any other purpose of the Company, and pTerminationing such application may, in their discretion, be employed in the business of the Company or be invested in such manner as the Directors may from time to time think fit. The Directors may also without placing the same to reserve carry forward any sums which they think it prudent not to distribute. CAPITALISATION OF PROFITS Capitalisation 144. The Directors may capitalise any sum standing to the credit of any of the Company’s reserve accounts which are available for distribution (including its Share Premium Account and capital redemption reserve fund, subject to the Law) or any sum standing to the credit of the profit and loss account or otherwise available for distribution and to appropriate such sums to Members in the proportions in which such sum would have been divisible amongst them had the same been a distribution of profits by way of dividTermination and to apply such sum on their behalf in paying up in full unissued Shares for allotment and distribution credited as fully paid-up to and amongst them in the proportion aforesaid. Authorisation 145. Where any difficulty arises in regard to any distribution under the last preceding Article, the Directors may settle the same as they think expedient and, in particular, may authorise any person to sell and Assignment any fractions or may resolve that the distribution should be as nearly as may be practicable in the correct proportion but not exactly so or may ignore fractions altogether, and may determine that cash payments should be made to any Members in order to adjust the rights of all parties, as may seem expedient to the Directors. The Directors may appoint any person to sign on behalf of the persons entitled to participate in the distribution any contract necessary or desirable for giving effect thereto and such appointment shall be effective and binding upon the Members. 33 SHARE PREMIUM ACCOUNT 146. The Directors shall in accordance with the Law establish a Share Premium Account and shall carry to the credit of such account from time to time a sum equal to the amount or value of the premium paid on the issue of any Share. 147. There shall be debited to any Share Premium Account on the redemption or purchase of a Share the difference between the nominal value of such Share and the redemption or purchase price provided always that at the discretion of the Directors such sum may be paid out of the profits of the Company or, if permitted by the Law, out of capital. ACCOUNTING RECORDS Books of account 148. The Directors shall cause to be kept accounting records sufficient to give a true and fair view of the state of the Company's affairs and to show and explain its transactions and otherwise in accordance with the Law. Inspection by Members 149. The accounting records shall be kept at the Registered Office or at such other place or places as the Directors think fit, and shall at all times be open to inspection by the Directors. No Member (who is not also a Director) shall have any right to inspect any accounting record or book or document of the Company except as conferred by law or authorised by the Directors or by the Members by Ordinary Resolution. Records and audit 150. From time to time the Company in general meeting may determine (or revoke, alter or amTermination any such determination) or, failing such determination, the Directors may determine (or revoke, alter or amTermination any such determination): 150.1 that the accounts of the Company be audited and the appointment of the Auditors; 150.2 that there be prepared and sent to each Member and other person entitled thereto a profit and loss account, a balance sheet, group accounts and/or reports for such period and on such terms as they may determine; and 150.3 that there be laid before the Company in general meeting a copy of every balance sheet together with a copy of the Auditor's report. 34 SERVICE OF NOTICES AND DOCUMENTS Form and delivery of notices 151. Notices or other documents or communications may be given to any Member by the Company either personally or by sTerminationing it by courier, post, fax or email to him to his registered address, or (if he has no registered address) to the address, if any, supplied by him to the Company for the giving of notices to him. Any notice shall be deemed to be effected: 151.1 if delivered personally or sent by courier, by properly addressing and prepaying a letter containing the notice; and to have been effected, in the case of a notice of a meeting, when delivered; 151.2 if sent by post, by properly addressing, prepaying, and posting a letter containing the notice (by airmail if available) and to have been effected, in the case of a notice of a meeting, at the Termination of three days after it was posted; and 151.3 if sent by fax or email by properly addressing and sTerminationing such notice through the appropriate transmitting medium and to have been effected on the day the same is sent. 152. A notice may be given by the Company to the joint holders of a Share by giving the notice to the joint holder named first in the Register of Members in respect of the Share. 153. A notice may be given by the Company to the person entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a Member by sTerminationing it through the post in a prepaid letter addressed to them by name, or by the title of representatives of the deceased, or trustee of the bankrupt, or by any like description, at the address, if any, supplied for the purpose by the persons claiming to be so entitled, or (until such an address has been so supplied) by giving the notice in any manner in which the same might have been given if the death or bankruptcy had not occurred. 154. Notice of every general meeting shall be given in any manner hereinbefore authorised to: 154.1 every Member entitled to vote except those Members entitled to vote who (having no registered address) have not supplied to the Company an address for the giving of notices to them; and 154.2 every person entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a Member, who, but for his death or bankruptcy would be entitled to receive notice of the meeting. 155. No other persons shall be entitled to receive notices of general meeting. 35 WINDING UP Method of winding up 156. Subject to the rights attaching to any Shares, if the Company shall be wound up, the liquidator may, with the sanction of a Special Resolution and any other sanction required by the Law or these Articles, divide amongst the Members in kind the whole or any part of the assets of the Company (whether they shall consist of property of the same kind or not) and may for such purpose set such value as he deems fair upon any property to be divided as aforesaid and may determine how such division shall be carried out as between the Members or different classes of Members. The liquidator may, with the like sanction, vest the whole or any part of such assets in trustees upon such trusts for the benefit of the contributories as the liquidator, with the like sanction, shall think fit, but so that no Member shall be compelled to accept any asset upon which there is any liability. Distribution of assets 157. If the Company shall be wound up and the assets available for distribution amongst the Members as such shall be insufficient to repay the whole of the paid up capital, such assets shall be distributed so that, as nearly as may be, the losses shall be borne by the Members in proportion to the capital paid up, or which ought to have been paid up, at the commencement of the winding up, on the Shares held by them respectively. And if in a winding up the assets available for distribution amongst the Members shall be more than sufficient to repay the whole of the capital paid up at the commencement of the winding up, the excess shall be distributed amongst the Members in proportion to the capital paid up at the commencement of the winding up on the Shares held by them respectively. This Article is to be without prejudice to the rights of the holders of Shares issued upon special terms and conditions. Indemnification Indemnification and limitation of liability 158. Every Indemnified Person shall, in the absence of wilful neglect or default, be indemnified and held harmless out of the assets of the Company against all liabilities, loss, damage, cost or expense (including but not limited to liabilities under contract, tort and statute or any applicable foreign law or regulation and all reasonable legal and other costs and expenses on a full Indemnification basis properly payable) incurred or suffered by him by or by reason of any act done, conceived in or omitted in the conduct of the Company’s business or in the discharge of his duties and the Indemnification contained in this Article shall extTermination to any Indemnified Person acting in any office or trust in the reasonable belief that he has been appointed or elected to such office or trust notwithstanding any defect in such appointment or election. 36 159. No Indemnified Person shall be liable to the Company for acts, defaults or omissions of any other Indemnified Person. Indemnification and reimbursement 160. Every Indemnified Person shall be indemnified out of the funds of the Company against all liabilities incurred by him by or by reason of any act done, conceived in or omitted in the conduct of the Company’s business or in the discharge of his duties in defTerminationing any proceedings, whether civil or criminal, in which judgment is given in his favour, or in which he is acquitted, or in connection with any application in which relief from liability is granted to him by the court. 161. To the extent that any Indemnified Person is entitled to claim an Indemnification pursuant to these Articles in respect of amounts paid or discharged by him, the relative Indemnification shall take effect as an obligation of the Company to reimburse the person making such payment or effecting such discharge. Wilful neglect or default 162. Each Member and the Company agree to waive any claim or right of action he or it may at any time have, whether individually or by or in the right of the Company, against any Indemnified Person on account of any act or omission of such Indemnified Person in the performance of his duties for the Company; provided however, that such waiver shall not apply to any claims or rights of action arising out of the wilful neglect or default of such Indemnified Person or to recover any gain, personal profit or advantage to which such Indemnified Person is not legally entitled. Advance of legal fees 163. Expenses incurred in defTerminationing any civil or criminal action or proceeding for which indemnification is required pursuant to these Articles shall be paid by the Company in advance of the final disposition of such action or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnified Person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that the Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified pursuant to these Articles. Each Member of the Company shall be deemed to have acknowledged and agreed that the advances of funds may be made by the Company as aforesaid, and when made by the Company under this Article are made to meet expTerminationitures incurred for the purpose of enabling such Indemnified Person to properly perform his or her duties to the Company. 37 CONTINUATION 164. The Company shall have the power, subject to the provisions of the Law and with the approval of a Special Resolution, to continue as a body incorporated under the laws of any jurisdiction outside of the Cayman Islands and to be de-registered in the Cayman Islands. AMTerminationMENT OF MEMORANDUM AND ARTICLES Subject to the provisions of the Law, the Company may from time to time by Special Resolution alter or amTermination the Memorandum or these Articles in whole or in part provided that no such amTerminationment shall affect the special rights attaching to any class of Shares without the consent or sanction provided for in these Articles. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Memorandum or in these Articles or in Law, for so long as HLNG is a Member, the Company shall not alter or amTermination the Memorandum or these Articles in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of HLNG 38 SCHEDULE A INSURANCE POLICIES Hull & Material Adverse Effecthinery insurance: All insurances carried, or to be carried, by the owner of the Vessel are placed as part of Höegh LNG’s fleet placements in the international insurance markets.

If a Member dies, the survivor or survivors (where he was a joint holder), and the legal personal representative (where he was sole holder), shall be the only person recognised by the Company as having any title to the Share. The estate of a deceased Member is not thereby released from any liability in respect of any Share held by him, whether solely or jointly. For the purpose of this Article, legal personal representative means the person to whom probate or letters of administration has or have been granted in the Cayman Islands or, if there is no such person, such other person as the Directors may in their absolute discretion determine to be the person recognised by the Company for the purpose of this Article. Election by persons entitled on transmission 22. Any person becoming entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a Member or otherwise by operation of Governing Law may elect, upon such evidence being produced as may be required by the Directors as to his entitlement, either be registered himself as a Member in respect of the Share or, instead of being registered himself, to make such Assignment of the Share as the deceased or bankrupt Member could have made. 7 Manner of election 23. If the person so becoming entitled elects to be registered himself, he shall deliver or sTermination to the Company a notice in writing signed by him stating that he so elects. If he shall elect to Assignment the Shares, he shall signify his election by signing an instrument of Assignment of such Shares in favour of his Assignmentee. All the limitations, restrictions and provisions of these Articles relating to the right to Assignment and the registration of Assignments of Shares shall be applicable to any such notice or instrument of Assignment as aforesaid as if the death of the Member or other event giving rise to the transmission had not occurred and the notice or instrument of Assignment was an instrument of Assignment signed by such Member. Rights of persons entitled on transmission 24. A person becoming entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of the Member (or otherwise by operation of Governing Law), upon such evidence being produced as may be required by the Directors as to his entitlement, shall be entitled to the same dividTerminations and other monies payable in respect of the Share as he would be entitled if he were the holder of such Share. However, he shall not be entitled, until he becomes registered as the holder of such Share, to receive notices of or to attTermination or vote at general meetings of the Company or (except as aforesaid) to exercise any other rights or privileges of a Member. The Directors may at any time give notice requiring such person to elect either to be registered himself or to Assignment the Share and, if the notice is not complied with within sixty days, the Directors may thereafter withhold payment of all dividTerminations and other monies payable in respect of the Shares until the requirements of the notice have been complied with. REDEMPTION AND PURCHASE OF SHARES 25. Subject to the provisions of the Law and the Memorandum, the Company may: 25.1 purchase its own Shares (including any redeemable Shares) in such manner and on such terms as the Directors may agree with the relevant Member unless following such purchase there would no longer be any issued Shares and may make payment for such purchase or for any redemption of Shares in any manner authorised by the Law, including out of capital; and 25.2 reduce its share capital and any capital redemption reserve fund in any manner whatsoever. 8 VARIATION OF SHARE RIGHTS Variation of class rights 26. If at any time the share capital is divided into different classes of Shares, all or any of the special rights attached to any class of Shares (unless otherwise provided by the terms of issue of the Shares of that class) may be varied or abrogated with the consent in writing of the holders of not less than two thirds of the issued Shares of that class or with the sanction of a resolution passed by the holders of not less than two thirds of the issued Shares of that class as may be present in person or by proxy at a separate general meeting of the holders of the Shares of that class. To any such separate general meeting, all of the provisions of these Articles relating to general meetings shall mutatis mutandis apply, but so that the necessary quorum shall be any one or more persons holding or representing by proxy not less than one third of the issued Shares of the class and that any holder of Shares of the relevant class present in person or by proxy may demand a poll. Treatment of classes 27. For the purpose of a separate class meeting, the Directors may treat two or more of all classes of Shares as forming one class if they consider that such class of Shares would be affected in the same way by the proposals under consideration. Effect of Share issue on class rights 28. The rights conferred upon the holders of any Shares shall not, unless otherwise expressly provided in the rights attaching to such Shares, be deemed to be altered by the creation or issue of further Shares ranking pari passu therewith. NON-RECOGNITION OF TRUSTS 29. Except as required by the Law or these Articles, or under an order of a court of competent jurisdiction, the Company shall not be bound by or compelled to recognise in any way, even when notice thereof is given to it, any equitable, contingent, future or partial interest in any Share, or any other rights in respect of any Share other than an absolute right to the entirety thereof in the registered holder. 9 LIEN Lien generally 30. The Company shall have a first and paramount lien on every Share (not being a fully paid Share) for all moneys (whether presently payable or not) called or payable at a date fixed by or in accordance with the terms of issue of such Share in respect of that Share, and the Company shall also have a first and paramount lien on every Share (other than a fully paid up Share) standing registered in the name of a Member, whether singly or jointly with any other person for all debts and liabilities of a Member or his estate to the Company, whether the same shall have been incurred before or after notice to the Company of any interest of any person other than such Member, and whether the time for the payment or discharge of the same shall have actually arrived or not, and notwithstanding that the same are joint debts or liabilities of such Member or his estate and any other person, whether a Member or not. The Directors may at any time, either generally or in any particular case, waive any lien that has arisen or declare any Share to be wholly or in part exempt from the provisions of this Article. The Company's lien, if any, on a Share shall extTermination to all dividTerminations payable thereon. Enforcement 31. The Company may sell, in such manner as the Directors think fit, any Share on which the Company has a lien, provided a sum in respect of which the lien exists is presently payable, and is not paid within fourteen days after a notice in writing has been given to the registered holder  for the time being of the Share, demanding payment of the sum presently payable and giving notice of the intention to sell in default of such payment. Completion of sale 32. For giving effect to any such sale, the Directors may authorise any person to Assignment the Share sold to the purchaser thereof. The purchaser shall be registered as the holder of the Share comprised in any such Assignment and he shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money, nor shall his title to the Share be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings relating to the sale. Application of proceeds 33. The net proceeds of such sale shall be applied in payment or discharge of the debt or liability in respect of which the lien exists and as is presently payable, and any balance shall (subject to a like lien for debts or liabilities not presently payable as existed upon the Shares prior to the sale) be paid to the person who was the registered holder of the Share immediately before such sale. CALLS ON SHARES Calls on Shares generally 34. The Directors may from time to time make calls upon the Members in respect of any moneys unpaid on their Shares (whether in respect of the par value of the Shares or premium or otherwise and not, by the terms of issue thereof, made payable at a future date fixed by or in accordance with such terms of issue); and each Member shall (subject to the Company serving upon him at least 14 days’ notice specifying the time or times and place of payment) pay to the Company at the time or times and place so specified the amount called on his Shares. A call may be revoked or postponed by the Directors wholly or in part as the Directors may determine. A call shall be deemed to have been made at the time when the resolution of the Directors authorising the call was passed. 10 Payment 35. Payment of a call may be made by instalments on the direction of the Directors. 36. If a sum called in respect of a Share is not paid before or on the day appointed for payment thereof, the person from whom the sum is due shall pay interest on the sum from the day payment is due to the time of the actual payment at such rate as the Directors may determine, but the Directors may waive payment of such interest wholly or in part. 37. Any sum payable in respect of a Share on issue or allotment or at any fixed date, whether in respect of the par value of the Share or premium or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a call and if it is not paid all the relevant provisions as to payment of interest, forfeiture or otherwise of these Articles shall apply as if such sum had become due and payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified. 38. The Directors may issue Shares with different terms as to the amount and times of payment of calls. Liability of joint holders 39. The joint holders of a Share shall be jointly and severally liable to pay calls in respect thereof. Interest 40. The Directors may, if they think fit, receive from any Member willing to advance the same, all or any part of the moneys uncalled and unpaid upon any Shares held by him; and may (until the amount would otherwise become payable) pay interest at such rate (not exceeding six per cent without the sanction of the Company in general meeting) as may be agreed upon between the Member paying the sum in advance and the Directors. FORFEITURE OF SHARES Notice 41. If a Member fails to pay any call or instalment of a call by the date it becomes due and payable, the Directors may, at any time thereafter while such call or instalment remains unpaid, give notice to the Member requiring payment of the unpaid portion of the call or instalment, together with any accrued interest and expenses incurred by the Company by reason of such non-payment. 11 42. The notice shall specify where and by what date (not being less than the Termination of 14 days’ from the date of the notice) payment is to be made and shall state that if it is not complied with the Shares in respect of which the call was made will be liable to be forfeited. The Directors may accept the surrTerminationer of any Share liable to be forfeited hereunder and, in such case, references to these Articles to forfeiture shall include surrTerminationer. Forfeiture for non-compliance 43. If such notice is not complied with, any Share in respect of which the notice was given may thereafter, before the payment of all calls or instalments and interest due in respect thereof has been made, be forfeited by a resolution of the Directors. Such forfeiture shall include all dividTerminations declared, other distributions or other monies payable in respect of the forfeited Shares and not paid before the forfeiture. Forfeited Shares 44. A forfeited Share may be sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed of upon such terms and in such manner as the Directors shall think fit, and at any time before a sale, re-allotment or disposition, the forfeiture may be cancelled on such terms as the Directors think fit. Continued liability for forfeited Member 45. A person whose Shares have been forfeited shall cease to be a Member in respect of the forfeited Shares, but shall remain liable to pay to the Company all moneys which at the date of forfeiture were presently payable by him in respect of the Shares together with interest at such rate as the Directors may determine from the date of forfeiture until payment, but his liability shall cease if and when the Company receives payment in full of all amounts due in respect of the Shares. The Company may enforce payment without being under any obligation to make any allowance for the value of the Shares forfeited. Evidence of forfeiture 46. An affidavit in writing by a Director or Secretary of the Company that a Share has been duly forfeited on a specified date, shall be conclusive evidence of the facts stated in it as against all persons claiming to be entitled to the Share. The Company may receive the consideration, if any, given for the Share on any sale, re-allotment or disposition thereof and may authorise some person to execute a Assignment of the Share in favour of the person to whom the Share is sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed of, and he shall thereupon be registered as the holder of the Share, and shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money (if any) nor shall his title to the Share be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings in reference to the forfeiture, sale, re-allotment or disposition of the Share. 12 47. The provisions of these Articles as to forfeiture shall apply in the case of non-payment of any sum which, by the terms of issue of a Share, becomes payable at a fixed time, whether on account of the par value of the Share, or by way of premium or otherwise, as if the same had been made payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified to the Member. INCREASE OF CAPITAL 48. The Company may from time to time by Ordinary Resolution increase its share capital by such sum, to be divided into new Shares of such par value, and with such rights, priorities and privileges attached thereto as the resolution shall prescribe. 49. Subject to any directions given by the Company in a general meeting, all new Shares shall be at the disposal of the Directors in accordance with these Articles. 50. The new Shares shall be subject to the same provisions of these Articles with reference to the payment of calls, lien, forfeiture, Assignment, transmission and otherwise, as the Shares in the original share capital. ALTERATION OF CAPITAL 51. The Company may from time to time by Ordinary Resolution: 51.1 consolidate and divide all or any of its share capital into Shares of larger par value than its existing Shares; 51.2 sub divide its existing Shares, or any of them, into Shares of smaller par value than is fixed by the Memorandum, subject nevertheless to the provisions of section 13 of the Law; 51.3 cancel any Shares which, at the date of the passing of the resolution, have not been taken or agreed to be taken by any person; and 51.4 convert all or any paid up Shares into stock, and reconvert all or any stock into paid up Shares of any denomination. 52. The Company may from time to time by Special Resolution: 52.1 divide its Shares into several classes and attach to such classes any preferential, deferred, or special rights or restrictions in accordance with these Articles; 52.2 change the currency denomination of its share capital; 13 52.3 reduce its share capital and any capital redemption reserve fund in any manner whatsoever; and 52.4 merge or consolidate with any one or more constituent companies (as defined in the Law).

In any other case, it shall stand adjourned to the same day in the next week, at the same time and place, and if at the adjourned meeting a quorum is not present within half an hour from the time appointed for the meeting, the Members present shall be a quorum.

If no Director is present, or if each of the Directors present declines to take the chair, the Members present and entitled to vote shall elect one of their number to be chairman. Adjournment of meeting 64. The chairman may, with the consent of a meeting at which a quorum is present (and shall if so directed by the meeting) adjourn the meeting from time to time and from place to place, but no business shall be transacted at any adjourned meeting other than the business left unfinished at the meeting from which the adjournment took place. When a meeting is adjourned for ten days or more, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given as in the case of an original meeting. Save as aforesaid, it shall not be necessary to give any notice of an adjournment or of the business to be transacted at an adjourned meeting.

Unless a poll is duly demanded and the demand is not withdrawn, a declaration by the chairman that a resolution has, on a show of hands, been carried or carried unanimously, or by a particular majority, or lost and an entry to that effect in the minutes of the proceedings of the Company shall be conclusive evidence of that fact, without proof of the number or proportion of the votes recorded in favour of, or against, that resolution. The demand for a poll may be withdrawn by the person or any persons making it at any time prior to the declaration of the result of the poll. 68. If a poll is duly demanded, it shall be taken in such manner as the chairman directs, and the result of the poll shall be deemed to be the resolution of the meeting at which the poll was demanded. 69. In the case of an equality of votes at a general meeting, whether on a show of hands or on a poll, the chairman of the meeting at which the show of hands takes place or at which the poll is demanded, shall not be entitled to a second or casting vote and the resolution shall fail. 70.

Voting on a poll 72. On a poll votes may be cast either personally or by proxy. 73.

In the case of joint holders of a Share, the vote of the senior who tTerminationers a vote, whether in person or by proxy, shall be accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint holders; and for this purpose seniority shall be determined by the order in which the names stand in the Register of Members in respect of the joint holding. 76. A Member of unsound mind, or, in respect of whom an order has been made by any court having jurisdiction in lunacy, may vote, whether on a show of hands or on a poll, by his receiver, committee, curator bonis or other person of similar nature appointed by such court, and any such receiver, committee, curator bonis or other person may vote by proxy and may otherwise act and be treated as such Member for the purpose of the general meetings. 77. No Member, unless the Directors otherwise determine, shall be entitled to vote at any general meeting, unless all calls or other sums presently payable by him in respect of Shares in the Company have been paid. 78. No objection shall be raised as to the qualification of any voter or as to whether any votes have been properly counted except at the general meeting or adjourned general meeting at which the vote objected to is given or tTerminationered and every vote not disallowed at the meeting shall be valid.

The Directors may delegate any of the powers exercisable by them to a Managing Director , Director or any other person or persons acting individually or jointly as they may from time to time by resolution appoint upon such terms and conditions and with such restrictions as they may think fit, and may from time to time by resolution revoke, withdraw, alter or vary all or any such powers. Alternate Directors 120. Any Director may by writing appoint any other Director, or other person willing to act, to be his alternate and remove his alternate so appointed by him. Such appointment or removal shall be by notice to the Registered Office signed by the Director making or revoking the appointment or in any other manner approved by the Directors, and shall be effective on the date the notice is served and the alternate shall be notified of such appointment or revocation. Subject to the removal by the appointing Director, the alternate shall continue in office until the date on which his appointor ceases to be a Director. An alternate may also be a Director in his own right and may act as alternate to more than one Director. 121. An alternate shall be entitled to receive notice of all meetings of the Directors, attTermination, be counted in the quorum, vote and act in such appointor’s place at every such meeting at which the appointing Director is not personally present, and generally to perform all the functions of his appointor as a Director in his absence. 122. These Articles (except as regards powers to appoint an alternate and remuneration) apply equally to the alternate as though he were the Director in his own right. 123. An alternate Director shall be deemed for all purposes to be a Director and shall alone be responsible for his own acts and defaults and shall not be deemed to be the agent of the Director appointing him. The signature of an alternate to any resolution in writing of the Director or a committee there shall, unless the terms of the appointment provides to the contrary, be as effective as the signature of the Director or Directors to whom he is alternate. 28 Committees of Directors 124. The Directors may delegate any of their powers to committees consisting of such member or members of their body as they think fit; any committee so formed shall, in the exercise of the powers so delegated, conform to any regulations that may be imposed on it by the Directors. 125. A committee may elect a chairman of its meetings; if no such chairman is elected, or if at any meeting the chairman is not present within five minutes after the time appointed for holding the same, the members present may choose one of their number to be chairman of the meeting. 126. A committee may meet and adjourn as it thinks proper. Questions arising at any meeting shall be determined by a majority of votes of the members present and in case of an equality of votes the chairman shall not have a second or casting vote and the motion shall be deemed to have been lost. Officers 127. The Directors may appoint a Secretary and such other officers as they may from time to time consider necessary upon such terms as to duration of office, remuneration and otherwise as they may think fit. Such Secretary or other officers need not be Directors and in the case of the other officers may be ascribed such titles as the Directors may decide and the Directors may revoke or terminate any such election or appointment. Any such revocation or termination shall be without prejudice to any claim for any damages that such officer may have against the Company or the Company may have against such officer for any breach of any contract of service between him and the Company which may be involved in such revocation or termination. Save as provided in the Law or these Articles, the powers and duties of the officers of the Company shall be such (if any) as are determined from time to time by the Directors. DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION Remuneration 128. The remuneration to be paid to the Directors, if any, shall be determined by the Company in general meeting or, in the absence of such a determination, by the Directors. Expenses 129. Each Director shall also be entitled to be paid his reasonable travelling, hotel and other expenses properly incurred by him in connection with his attTerminationance at meetings of the Directors, committees of the Directors or general meetings of the Company, or otherwise in connection with the business of the Company, or to receive a fixed allowance in respect thereof as may be determined by the Directors, or a combination partly of one such method and partly the other. 29 Additional remuneration 130. The Directors may by resolution approve additional remuneration to any Director for services which in the opinion of the Directors go beyond the ordinary duties of a Director, and such extra remuneration shall be in addition to any remuneration provided for, by or pursuant to any other Article. SEALS AND DEEDS Use of Seal 131. The Directors may determine that the Company shall have a Seal, and if they so determine, shall provide for the safe custody of the Seal. The Seal shall only be used by the authority of the Directors and in the presence of a Director or the Secretary or such other person as the Directors may by resolution appoint for this purpose, and every instrument to which the Seal affixed shall be signed by the relevant person. Notwithstanding the above, annual returns and notices filed under the Law may be executed either as a deed or under Seal and in either case without the need for the authority of a resolution of the Directors. 30 Duplicate Seal 132. The Company may maintain in any place or places outside the Cayman Islands a facsimile of any Seal and such facsimile seal shall be affixed in the same way as if it were the Seal. Execution of deeds 133. In accordance with the Law, the Company may execute any deed or other instrument (which would otherwise be required to be executed under Seal) by the signature of such deed or instrument as a deed by a Director or by the Secretary of the Company or by such other person as the Directors may appoint or by any other person or attorney on behalf of the Company appointed by a deed or other instrument executed as a deed by a Director or the Secretary or such other person as aforesaid. DIVIDTerminationS Payment of DividTerminations 134. The Directors may from time to time declare dividTerminations to be paid to the Members according to their rights and interests, including such interim dividTerminations as appear to the Directors to be justified by the position of the Company. The Directors may also pay any fixed cash dividTermination which is payable on any Shares of the Company half yearly or on such other dates, whenever the position of the Company, in the opinion of the Directors, justifies such payment. 135. No dividTermination shall be paid otherwise than out of profits or out of monies otherwise available for dividTermination in accordance with the Law. Calculation of DividTerminations 136. Subject to the rights of Members, if any, entitled to Shares with special rights as to dividTerminations, all dividTerminations shall be declared and paid according to the amount paid up on the Shares in respect of which the dividTermination is paid and any dividTermination on any class of Shares not fully paid shall be declared and paid according to the amounts paid on the Shares of that class, but if and so long as nothing is paid up on any of the Shares in the Company, dividTerminations may be declared and paid according to the number of Shares. No amount paid on a Share in advance of calls shall, while carrying interest, be treated for the purposes of this Article as paid on the Share. DividTerminations may be apportioned and paid pro rata according to the amounts paid-up on the Shares during any portion or portions of the period in respect of which the dividTermination is paid. 31 Deductions 137. The Directors may deduct from any dividTermination, distribution or other monies payable to a Member by the Company on or in respect of any Shares all sums of money (if any) presently payable by him to the Company on account of calls or otherwise in respect of Shares of the Company. Joint Holders 138. If several persons are registered as joint holders of any Share, any of them may give effectual receipts for any dividTermination or other money payable on or in respect of the Share. Payment method 139. Any dividTermination may be paid by cheque or warrant sent through the post to the address of the Member or person entitled thereto in the Register of Members or, in the case of joint holders addressed to the holder whose name stands first in the Register of Members in respect of the Shares at his registered address as appearing on the Register of Members or to such person and such address as the Member or person entitled or such joint holders as the case may be may direct in writing. Every such cheque or warrant shall, unless the holder or joint holders may in writing direct, be made payable to the order of the person to whom it is sent or to the order of the holder or, in the case of joint holders, to the order of the holder whose name stands first in the Register of Members in respect of such Shares, and shall be sent at his or their risk and payment of the cheque or warrant by the bank on which it is drawn shall constitute a good discharge to the Company. Any one of two or more joint holders may give effectual receipts for any dividTerminations, distributions or other monies payable or property distributable in respect of the Shares held by such joint holders. Satisfaction by distribution of specific assets 140. The Directors may declare that any dividTermination or distribution is paid wholly or partly by the distribution of specific assets and, in particular, of paid up shares, debentures or debenture stock of any other company or in any one or more of such ways, and where any difficulty arises in regard to such dividTermination or distribution, the Directors may settle the same as they think expedient, and in particular may issue fractional Shares or ignore fractions altogether and may fix the value for dividTermination or distribution of such specific assets or any part thereof and may determine that cash payments shall be made to any Members upon the basis of the value so fixed in order to secure equality of distribution, and may vest any such specific assets in trustees as may seem expedient to the Directors. 32 No interest 141. No dividTermination or other distribution or other monies payable by the Company on or in respect of any Share shall bear interest against the Company. Unclaimed dividTerminations 142. All unclaimed dividTerminations or distributions may be invested or otherwise made use of by the Directors for the benefit of the Company until claimed. Any dividTermination or distribution unclaimed by a Member six years after the dividTermination or distribution payment date shall be forfeited and revert to the Company. RESERVES 143. The Directors may, before declaring any dividTermination or distribution, set aside such sums as they think proper as a reserve or reserves which shall, at the discretion of the Directors, be applicable for meeting contingencies, or for equalising dividTerminations, or for any other purpose of the Company, and pTerminationing such application may, in their discretion, be employed in the business of the Company or be invested in such manner as the Directors may from time to time think fit. The Directors may also without placing the same to reserve carry forward any sums which they think it prudent not to distribute. CAPITALISATION OF PROFITS Capitalisation 144. The Directors may capitalise any sum standing to the credit of any of the Company’s reserve accounts which are available for distribution (including its Share Premium Account and capital redemption reserve fund, subject to the Law) or any sum standing to the credit of the profit and loss account or otherwise available for distribution and to appropriate such sums to Members in the proportions in which such sum would have been divisible amongst them had the same been a distribution of profits by way of dividTermination and to apply such sum on their behalf in paying up in full unissued Shares for allotment and distribution credited as fully paid-up to and amongst them in the proportion aforesaid. Authorisation 145. Where any difficulty arises in regard to any distribution under the last preceding Article, the Directors may settle the same as they think expedient and, in particular, may authorise any person to sell and Assignment any fractions or may resolve that the distribution should be as nearly as may be practicable in the correct proportion but not exactly so or may ignore fractions altogether, and may determine that cash payments should be made to any Members in order to adjust the rights of all parties, as may seem expedient to the Directors. The Directors may appoint any person to sign on behalf of the persons entitled to participate in the distribution any contract necessary or desirable for giving effect thereto and such appointment shall be effective and binding upon the Members. 33 SHARE PREMIUM ACCOUNT 146. The Directors shall in accordance with the Law establish a Share Premium Account and shall carry to the credit of such account from time to time a sum equal to the amount or value of the premium paid on the issue of any Share. 147. There shall be debited to any Share Premium Account on the redemption or purchase of a Share the difference between the nominal value of such Share and the redemption or purchase price provided always that at the discretion of the Directors such sum may be paid out of the profits of the Company or, if permitted by the Law, out of capital. ACCOUNTING RECORDS Books of account 148. The Directors shall cause to be kept accounting records sufficient to give a true and fair view of the state of the Company's affairs and to show and explain its transactions and otherwise in accordance with the Law. Inspection by Members 149. The accounting records shall be kept at the Registered Office or at such other place or places as the Directors think fit, and shall at all times be open to inspection by the Directors. No Member (who is not also a Director) shall have any right to inspect any accounting record or book or document of the Company except as conferred by law or authorised by the Directors or by the Members by Ordinary Resolution. Records and audit 150. From time to time the Company in general meeting may determine (or revoke, alter or amTermination any such determination) or, failing such determination, the Directors may determine (or revoke, alter or amTermination any such determination): 150.1 that the accounts of the Company be audited and the appointment of the Auditors; 150.2 that there be prepared and sent to each Member and other person entitled thereto a profit and loss account, a balance sheet, group accounts and/or reports for such period and on such terms as they may determine; and 150.3 that there be laid before the Company in general meeting a copy of every balance sheet together with a copy of the Auditor's report. 34 SERVICE OF NOTICES AND DOCUMENTS Form and delivery of notices 151. Notices or other documents or communications may be given to any Member by the Company either personally or by sTerminationing it by courier, post, fax or email to him to his registered address, or (if he has no registered address) to the address, if any, supplied by him to the Company for the giving of notices to him. Any notice shall be deemed to be effected: 151.1 if delivered personally or sent by courier, by properly addressing and prepaying a letter containing the notice; and to have been effected, in the case of a notice of a meeting, when delivered; 151.2 if sent by post, by properly addressing, prepaying, and posting a letter containing the notice (by airmail if available) and to have been effected, in the case of a notice of a meeting, at the Termination of three days after it was posted; and 151.3 if sent by fax or email by properly addressing and sTerminationing such notice through the appropriate transmitting medium and to have been effected on the day the same is sent. 152. A notice may be given by the Company to the joint holders of a Share by giving the notice to the joint holder named first in the Register of Members in respect of the Share. 153. A notice may be given by the Company to the person entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a Member by sTerminationing it through the post in a prepaid letter addressed to them by name, or by the title of representatives of the deceased, or trustee of the bankrupt, or by any like description, at the address, if any, supplied for the purpose by the persons claiming to be so entitled, or (until such an address has been so supplied) by giving the notice in any manner in which the same might have been given if the death or bankruptcy had not occurred. 154. Notice of every general meeting shall be given in any manner hereinbefore authorised to: 154.1 every Member entitled to vote except those Members entitled to vote who (having no registered address) have not supplied to the Company an address for the giving of notices to them; and 154.2 every person entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a Member, who, but for his death or bankruptcy would be entitled to receive notice of the meeting. 155. No other persons shall be entitled to receive notices of general meeting. 35 WINDING UP Method of winding up 156. Subject to the rights attaching to any Shares, if the Company shall be wound up, the liquidator may, with the sanction of a Special Resolution and any other sanction required by the Law or these Articles, divide amongst the Members in kind the whole or any part of the assets of the Company (whether they shall consist of property of the same kind or not) and may for such purpose set such value as he deems fair upon any property to be divided as aforesaid and may determine how such division shall be carried out as between the Members or different classes of Members. The liquidator may, with the like sanction, vest the whole or any part of such assets in trustees upon such trusts for the benefit of the contributories as the liquidator, with the like sanction, shall think fit, but so that no Member shall be compelled to accept any asset upon which there is any liability. Distribution of assets 157. If the Company shall be wound up and the assets available for distribution amongst the Members as such shall be insufficient to repay the whole of the paid up capital, such assets shall be distributed so that, as nearly as may be, the losses shall be borne by the Members in proportion to the capital paid up, or which ought to have been paid up, at the commencement of the winding up, on the Shares held by them respectively. And if in a winding up the assets available for distribution amongst the Members shall be more than sufficient to repay the whole of the capital paid up at the commencement of the winding up, the excess shall be distributed amongst the Members in proportion to the capital paid up at the commencement of the winding up on the Shares held by them respectively. This Article is to be without prejudice to the rights of the holders of Shares issued upon special terms and conditions. Indemnification Indemnification and limitation of liability 158. Every Indemnified Person shall, in the absence of wilful neglect or default, be indemnified and held harmless out of the assets of the Company against all liabilities, loss, damage, cost or expense (including but not limited to liabilities under contract, tort and statute or any applicable foreign law or regulation and all reasonable legal and other costs and expenses on a full Indemnification basis properly payable) incurred or suffered by him by or by reason of any act done, conceived in or omitted in the conduct of the Company’s business or in the discharge of his duties and the Indemnification contained in this Article shall extTermination to any Indemnified Person acting in any office or trust in the reasonable belief that he has been appointed or elected to such office or trust notwithstanding any defect in such appointment or election. 36 159. No Indemnified Person shall be liable to the Company for acts, defaults or omissions of any other Indemnified Person. Indemnification and reimbursement 160. Every Indemnified Person shall be indemnified out of the funds of the Company against all liabilities incurred by him by or by reason of any act done, conceived in or omitted in the conduct of the Company’s business or in the discharge of his duties in defTerminationing any proceedings, whether civil or criminal, in which judgment is given in his favour, or in which he is acquitted, or in connection with any application in which relief from liability is granted to him by the court. 161. To the extent that any Indemnified Person is entitled to claim an Indemnification pursuant to these Articles in respect of amounts paid or discharged by him, the relative Indemnification shall take effect as an obligation of the Company to reimburse the person making such payment or effecting such discharge. Wilful neglect or default 162. Each Member and the Company agree to waive any claim or right of action he or it may at any time have, whether individually or by or in the right of the Company, against any Indemnified Person on account of any act or omission of such Indemnified Person in the performance of his duties for the Company; provided however, that such waiver shall not apply to any claims or rights of action arising out of the wilful neglect or default of such Indemnified Person or to recover any gain, personal profit or advantage to which such Indemnified Person is not legally entitled. Advance of legal fees 163. Expenses incurred in defTerminationing any civil or criminal action or proceeding for which indemnification is required pursuant to these Articles shall be paid by the Company in advance of the final disposition of such action or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnified Person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that the Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified pursuant to these Articles. Each Member of the Company shall be deemed to have acknowledged and agreed that the advances of funds may be made by the Company as aforesaid, and when made by the Company under this Article are made to meet expTerminationitures incurred for the purpose of enabling such Indemnified Person to properly perform his or her duties to the Company. 37 CONTINUATION 164. The Company shall have the power, subject to the provisions of the Law and with the approval of a Special Resolution, to continue as a body incorporated under the laws of any jurisdiction outside of the Cayman Islands and to be de-registered in the Cayman Islands. AMTerminationMENT OF MEMORANDUM AND ARTICLES Subject to the provisions of the Law, the Company may from time to time by Special Resolution alter or amTermination the Memorandum or these Articles in whole or in part provided that no such amTerminationment shall affect the special rights attaching to any class of Shares without the consent or sanction provided for in these Articles. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Memorandum or in these Articles or in Law, for so long as HLNG is a Member, the Company shall not alter or amTermination the Memorandum or these Articles in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of HLNG 38 SCHEDULE A INSURANCE POLICIES Hull & Material Adverse Effecthinery insurance: All insurances carried, or to be carried, by the owner of the Vessel are placed as part of Höegh LNG’s fleet placements in the international insurance markets.

The Directors may fix in advance a date as the record date to determine the Members entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of the Members and, for the purpose of determining the Members entitled to receive payment of any dividTermination, the Directors may, at or within 90 days prior to the date of the declaration of such dividTermination, fix a subsequent date as the record date for such determination. No fixed record date 11. If no such record date is fixed, the record date shall be the date on which notice of the meeting is sent or the date on which the resolution of the Directors declaring such dividTermination is adopted, as the case may be. A determination of Members entitled to vote at any meeting of Members in accordance with this Article, shall apply to any adjournment thereof. SHARE CERTIFICATES Issue of Share Certificates 12. Every Member shall be entitled, without payment, to a certificate of the Company specifying the Share or Shares held by him and the amount paid up thereon. 13. Notwithstanding the provisions of these Articles, the Directors may resolve not to issue share certificates to Members of the Company. Certificates for jointly-held Shares 14. The Company shall not be bound to issue more than one certificate for Shares held jointly by more than one person, and delivery of a certificate to one joint holder shall be sufficient delivery to all. Replacement Share Certificates 15. If a share certificate is defaced, lost or destroyed, it may be replaced on payment of such fee (if any) and on such terms (if any) as to evidence and Indemnification, and on the payment of expenses of the Company in investigating such evidence and preparing such Indemnification as the Directors shall think fit and, in case of defacement, on delivery of the old certificate to the Company for cancellation. 6 Assignment OF SHARES Instrument of Assignment 16. The instrument of Assignment of any Share shall be executed by or on behalf of the Assignmentor (and, if the Directors so determine, the Assignmentee). The Assignmentor shall be deemed to remain the holder of the Share until the name of the Assignmentee is entered in the Register of Members in respect of such Share. All instruments of Assignment, once registered, may be retained by the Company. 17. Subject to any applicable restrictions contained in these Articles, Shares shall be Assignmentred in any usual or common form approved by the Directors. Refusal to register Assignments 18. The Directors may, in their absolute discretion and without assigning any reason therefore, decline to register any Assignment of any Share. The Directors may require reasonable evidence to show the right of the Assignmentor to make the Assignment. 19. If the Directors decline to register a Assignment of Shares they shall sTermination notice of the refusal to the Assignmentee within one month after the date on which the Assignment was lodged with the Company. 20. The Directors may also suspTermination the registration of the Assignments at such times and for such periods as the Directors may from time to time determine. TRANSMISSION OF SHARES Transmission of Shares 21. If a Member dies, the survivor or survivors (where he was a joint holder), and the legal personal representative (where he was sole holder), shall be the only person recognised by the Company as having any title to the Share. The estate of a deceased Member is not thereby released from any liability in respect of any Share held by him, whether solely or jointly. For the purpose of this Article, legal personal representative means the person to whom probate or letters of administration has or have been granted in the Cayman Islands or, if there is no such person, such other person as the Directors may in their absolute discretion determine to be the person recognised by the Company for the purpose of this Article. Election by persons entitled on transmission 22. Any person becoming entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a Member or otherwise by operation of Governing Law may elect, upon such evidence being produced as may be required by the Directors as to his entitlement, either be registered himself as a Member in respect of the Share or, instead of being registered himself, to make such Assignment of the Share as the deceased or bankrupt Member could have made. 7 Manner of election 23. If the person so becoming entitled elects to be registered himself, he shall deliver or sTermination to the Company a notice in writing signed by him stating that he so elects. If he shall elect to Assignment the Shares, he shall signify his election by signing an instrument of Assignment of such Shares in favour of his Assignmentee. All the limitations, restrictions and provisions of these Articles relating to the right to Assignment and the registration of Assignments of Shares shall be applicable to any such notice or instrument of Assignment as aforesaid as if the death of the Member or other event giving rise to the transmission had not occurred and the notice or instrument of Assignment was an instrument of Assignment signed by such Member. Rights of persons entitled on transmission 24. A person becoming entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of the Member (or otherwise by operation of Governing Law), upon such evidence being produced as may be required by the Directors as to his entitlement, shall be entitled to the same dividTerminations and other monies payable in respect of the Share as he would be entitled if he were the holder of such Share. However, he shall not be entitled, until he becomes registered as the holder of such Share, to receive notices of or to attTermination or vote at general meetings of the Company or (except as aforesaid) to exercise any other rights or privileges of a Member. The Directors may at any time give notice requiring such person to elect either to be registered himself or to Assignment the Share and, if the notice is not complied with within sixty days, the Directors may thereafter withhold payment of all dividTerminations and other monies payable in respect of the Shares until the requirements of the notice have been complied with. REDEMPTION AND PURCHASE OF SHARES 25. Subject to the provisions of the Law and the Memorandum, the Company may: 25.1 purchase its own Shares (including any redeemable Shares) in such manner and on such terms as the Directors may agree with the relevant Member unless following such purchase there would no longer be any issued Shares and may make payment for such purchase or for any redemption of Shares in any manner authorised by the Law, including out of capital; and 25.2 reduce its share capital and any capital redemption reserve fund in any manner whatsoever. 8 VARIATION OF SHARE RIGHTS Variation of class rights 26. If at any time the share capital is divided into different classes of Shares, all or any of the special rights attached to any class of Shares (unless otherwise provided by the terms of issue of the Shares of that class) may be varied or abrogated with the consent in writing of the holders of not less than two thirds of the issued Shares of that class or with the sanction of a resolution passed by the holders of not less than two thirds of the issued Shares of that class as may be present in person or by proxy at a separate general meeting of the holders of the Shares of that class. To any such separate general meeting, all of the provisions of these Articles relating to general meetings shall mutatis mutandis apply, but so that the necessary quorum shall be any one or more persons holding or representing by proxy not less than one third of the issued Shares of the class and that any holder of Shares of the relevant class present in person or by proxy may demand a poll. Treatment of classes 27. For the purpose of a separate class meeting, the Directors may treat two or more of all classes of Shares as forming one class if they consider that such class of Shares would be affected in the same way by the proposals under consideration. Effect of Share issue on class rights 28. The rights conferred upon the holders of any Shares shall not, unless otherwise expressly provided in the rights attaching to such Shares, be deemed to be altered by the creation or issue of further Shares ranking pari passu therewith. NON-RECOGNITION OF TRUSTS 29. Except as required by the Law or these Articles, or under an order of a court of competent jurisdiction, the Company shall not be bound by or compelled to recognise in any way, even when notice thereof is given to it, any equitable, contingent, future or partial interest in any Share, or any other rights in respect of any Share other than an absolute right to the entirety thereof in the registered holder. 9 LIEN Lien generally 30. The Company shall have a first and paramount lien on every Share (not being a fully paid Share) for all moneys (whether presently payable or not) called or payable at a date fixed by or in accordance with the terms of issue of such Share in respect of that Share, and the Company shall also have a first and paramount lien on every Share (other than a fully paid up Share) standing registered in the name of a Member, whether singly or jointly with any other person for all debts and liabilities of a Member or his estate to the Company, whether the same shall have been incurred before or after notice to the Company of any interest of any person other than such Member, and whether the time for the payment or discharge of the same shall have actually arrived or not, and notwithstanding that the same are joint debts or liabilities of such Member or his estate and any other person, whether a Member or not. The Directors may at any time, either generally or in any particular case, waive any lien that has arisen or declare any Share to be wholly or in part exempt from the provisions of this Article. The Company's lien, if any, on a Share shall extTermination to all dividTerminations payable thereon. Enforcement 31. The Company may sell, in such manner as the Directors think fit, any Share on which the Company has a lien, provided a sum in respect of which the lien exists is presently payable, and is not paid within fourteen days after a notice in writing has been given to the registered holder  for the time being of the Share, demanding payment of the sum presently payable and giving notice of the intention to sell in default of such payment. Completion of sale 32. For giving effect to any such sale, the Directors may authorise any person to Assignment the Share sold to the purchaser thereof. The purchaser shall be registered as the holder of the Share comprised in any such Assignment and he shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money, nor shall his title to the Share be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings relating to the sale. Application of proceeds 33. The net proceeds of such sale shall be applied in payment or discharge of the debt or liability in respect of which the lien exists and as is presently payable, and any balance shall (subject to a like lien for debts or liabilities not presently payable as existed upon the Shares prior to the sale) be paid to the person who was the registered holder of the Share immediately before such sale. CALLS ON SHARES Calls on Shares generally 34. The Directors may from time to time make calls upon the Members in respect of any moneys unpaid on their Shares (whether in respect of the par value of the Shares or premium or otherwise and not, by the terms of issue thereof, made payable at a future date fixed by or in accordance with such terms of issue); and each Member shall (subject to the Company serving upon him at least 14 days’ notice specifying the time or times and place of payment) pay to the Company at the time or times and place so specified the amount called on his Shares. A call may be revoked or postponed by the Directors wholly or in part as the Directors may determine. A call shall be deemed to have been made at the time when the resolution of the Directors authorising the call was passed. 10 Payment 35. Payment of a call may be made by instalments on the direction of the Directors. 36. If a sum called in respect of a Share is not paid before or on the day appointed for payment thereof, the person from whom the sum is due shall pay interest on the sum from the day payment is due to the time of the actual payment at such rate as the Directors may determine, but the Directors may waive payment of such interest wholly or in part. 37. Any sum payable in respect of a Share on issue or allotment or at any fixed date, whether in respect of the par value of the Share or premium or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a call and if it is not paid all the relevant provisions as to payment of interest, forfeiture or otherwise of these Articles shall apply as if such sum had become due and payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified. 38. The Directors may issue Shares with different terms as to the amount and times of payment of calls. Liability of joint holders 39. The joint holders of a Share shall be jointly and severally liable to pay calls in respect thereof. Interest 40. The Directors may, if they think fit, receive from any Member willing to advance the same, all or any part of the moneys uncalled and unpaid upon any Shares held by him; and may (until the amount would otherwise become payable) pay interest at such rate (not exceeding six per cent without the sanction of the Company in general meeting) as may be agreed upon between the Member paying the sum in advance and the Directors. FORFEITURE OF SHARES Notice 41. If a Member fails to pay any call or instalment of a call by the date it becomes due and payable, the Directors may, at any time thereafter while such call or instalment remains unpaid, give notice to the Member requiring payment of the unpaid portion of the call or instalment, together with any accrued interest and expenses incurred by the Company by reason of such non-payment. 11 42. The notice shall specify where and by what date (not being less than the Termination of 14 days’ from the date of the notice) payment is to be made and shall state that if it is not complied with the Shares in respect of which the call was made will be liable to be forfeited. The Directors may accept the surrTerminationer of any Share liable to be forfeited hereunder and, in such case, references to these Articles to forfeiture shall include surrTerminationer. Forfeiture for non-compliance 43. If such notice is not complied with, any Share in respect of which the notice was given may thereafter, before the payment of all calls or instalments and interest due in respect thereof has been made, be forfeited by a resolution of the Directors. Such forfeiture shall include all dividTerminations declared, other distributions or other monies payable in respect of the forfeited Shares and not paid before the forfeiture. Forfeited Shares 44. A forfeited Share may be sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed of upon such terms and in such manner as the Directors shall think fit, and at any time before a sale, re-allotment or disposition, the forfeiture may be cancelled on such terms as the Directors think fit. Continued liability for forfeited Member 45. A person whose Shares have been forfeited shall cease to be a Member in respect of the forfeited Shares, but shall remain liable to pay to the Company all moneys which at the date of forfeiture were presently payable by him in respect of the Shares together with interest at such rate as the Directors may determine from the date of forfeiture until payment, but his liability shall cease if and when the Company receives payment in full of all amounts due in respect of the Shares. The Company may enforce payment without being under any obligation to make any allowance for the value of the Shares forfeited. Evidence of forfeiture 46. An affidavit in writing by a Director or Secretary of the Company that a Share has been duly forfeited on a specified date, shall be conclusive evidence of the facts stated in it as against all persons claiming to be entitled to the Share. The Company may receive the consideration, if any, given for the Share on any sale, re-allotment or disposition thereof and may authorise some person to execute a Assignment of the Share in favour of the person to whom the Share is sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed of, and he shall thereupon be registered as the holder of the Share, and shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money (if any) nor shall his title to the Share be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings in reference to the forfeiture, sale, re-allotment or disposition of the Share. 12 47. The provisions of these Articles as to forfeiture shall apply in the case of non-payment of any sum which, by the terms of issue of a Share, becomes payable at a fixed time, whether on account of the par value of the Share, or by way of premium or otherwise, as if the same had been made payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified to the Member. INCREASE OF CAPITAL 48. The Company may from time to time by Ordinary Resolution increase its share capital by such sum, to be divided into new Shares of such par value, and with such rights, priorities and privileges attached thereto as the resolution shall prescribe. 49. Subject to any directions given by the Company in a general meeting, all new Shares shall be at the disposal of the Directors in accordance with these Articles. 50. The new Shares shall be subject to the same provisions of these Articles with reference to the payment of calls, lien, forfeiture, Assignment, transmission and otherwise, as the Shares in the original share capital. ALTERATION OF CAPITAL 51. The Company may from time to time by Ordinary Resolution: 51.1 consolidate and divide all or any of its share capital into Shares of larger par value than its existing Shares; 51.2 sub divide its existing Shares, or any of them, into Shares of smaller par value than is fixed by the Memorandum, subject nevertheless to the provisions of section 13 of the Law; 51.3 cancel any Shares which, at the date of the passing of the resolution, have not been taken or agreed to be taken by any person; and 51.4 convert all or any paid up Shares into stock, and reconvert all or any stock into paid up Shares of any denomination. 52. The Company may from time to time by Special Resolution: 52.1 divide its Shares into several classes and attach to such classes any preferential, deferred, or special rights or restrictions in accordance with these Articles; 52.2 change the currency denomination of its share capital; 13 52.3 reduce its share capital and any capital redemption reserve fund in any manner whatsoever; and 52.4 merge or consolidate with any one or more constituent companies (as defined in the Law). GENERAL MEETINGS Convening a meeting 53. The Directors may, whenever they think fit, convene an extraordinary general meeting. If at any time there are not sufficient Directors capable of acting to form a quorum, any Director, or any one or more Members holding in the aggregate not less than one third of the total issued share capital of the Company entitled to vote, may convene an extraordinary general meeting in the same manner as nearly as possible as that in which meetings may be convened by the Directors. Members’ requisition 54.

The demand for a poll may be withdrawn by the person or any persons making it at any time prior to the declaration of the result of the poll. 68. If a poll is duly demanded, it shall be taken in such manner as the chairman directs, and the result of the poll shall be deemed to be the resolution of the meeting at which the poll was demanded. 69.

In accordance with the Law, the Company may execute any deed or other instrument (which would otherwise be required to be executed under Seal) by the signature of such deed or instrument as a deed by a Director or by the Secretary of the Company or by such other person as the Directors may appoint or by any other person or attorney on behalf of the Company appointed by a deed or other instrument executed as a deed by a Director or the Secretary or such other person as aforesaid. DIVIDTerminationS Payment of DividTerminations 134. The Directors may from time to time declare dividTerminations to be paid to the Members according to their rights and interests, including such interim dividTerminations as appear to the Directors to be justified by the position of the Company. The Directors may also pay any fixed cash dividTermination which is payable on any Shares of the Company half yearly or on such other dates, whenever the position of the Company, in the opinion of the Directors, justifies such payment. 135. No dividTermination shall be paid otherwise than out of profits or out of monies otherwise available for dividTermination in accordance with the Law. Calculation of DividTerminations 136. Subject to the rights of Members, if any, entitled to Shares with special rights as to dividTerminations, all dividTerminations shall be declared and paid according to the amount paid up on the Shares in respect of which the dividTermination is paid and any dividTermination on any class of Shares not fully paid shall be declared and paid according to the amounts paid on the Shares of that class, but if and so long as nothing is paid up on any of the Shares in the Company, dividTerminations may be declared and paid according to the number of Shares. No amount paid on a Share in advance of calls shall, while carrying interest, be treated for the purposes of this Article as paid on the Share. DividTerminations may be apportioned and paid pro rata according to the amounts paid-up on the Shares during any portion or portions of the period in respect of which the dividTermination is paid. 31 Deductions 137. The Directors may deduct from any dividTermination, distribution or other monies payable to a Member by the Company on or in respect of any Shares all sums of money (if any) presently payable by him to the Company on account of calls or otherwise in respect of Shares of the Company. Joint Holders 138. If several persons are registered as joint holders of any Share, any of them may give effectual receipts for any dividTermination or other money payable on or in respect of the Share. Payment method 139. Any dividTermination may be paid by cheque or warrant sent through the post to the address of the Member or person entitled thereto in the Register of Members or, in the case of joint holders addressed to the holder whose name stands first in the Register of Members in respect of the Shares at his registered address as appearing on the Register of Members or to such person and such address as the Member or person entitled or such joint holders as the case may be may direct in writing. Every such cheque or warrant shall, unless the holder or joint holders may in writing direct, be made payable to the order of the person to whom it is sent or to the order of the holder or, in the case of joint holders, to the order of the holder whose name stands first in the Register of Members in respect of such Shares, and shall be sent at his or their risk and payment of the cheque or warrant by the bank on which it is drawn shall constitute a good discharge to the Company. Any one of two or more joint holders may give effectual receipts for any dividTerminations, distributions or other monies payable or property distributable in respect of the Shares held by such joint holders. Satisfaction by distribution of specific assets 140. The Directors may declare that any dividTermination or distribution is paid wholly or partly by the distribution of specific assets and, in particular, of paid up shares, debentures or debenture stock of any other company or in any one or more of such ways, and where any difficulty arises in regard to such dividTermination or distribution, the Directors may settle the same as they think expedient, and in particular may issue fractional Shares or ignore fractions altogether and may fix the value for dividTermination or distribution of such specific assets or any part thereof and may determine that cash payments shall be made to any Members upon the basis of the value so fixed in order to secure equality of distribution, and may vest any such specific assets in trustees as may seem expedient to the Directors. 32 No interest 141. No dividTermination or other distribution or other monies payable by the Company on or in respect of any Share shall bear interest against the Company. Unclaimed dividTerminations 142. All unclaimed dividTerminations or distributions may be invested or otherwise made use of by the Directors for the benefit of the Company until claimed. Any dividTermination or distribution unclaimed by a Member six years after the dividTermination or distribution payment date shall be forfeited and revert to the Company. RESERVES 143. The Directors may, before declaring any dividTermination or distribution, set aside such sums as they think proper as a reserve or reserves which shall, at the discretion of the Directors, be applicable for meeting contingencies, or for equalising dividTerminations, or for any other purpose of the Company, and pTerminationing such application may, in their discretion, be employed in the business of the Company or be invested in such manner as the Directors may from time to time think fit. The Directors may also without placing the same to reserve carry forward any sums which they think it prudent not to distribute. CAPITALISATION OF PROFITS Capitalisation 144. The Directors may capitalise any sum standing to the credit of any of the Company’s reserve accounts which are available for distribution (including its Share Premium Account and capital redemption reserve fund, subject to the Law) or any sum standing to the credit of the profit and loss account or otherwise available for distribution and to appropriate such sums to Members in the proportions in which such sum would have been divisible amongst them had the same been a distribution of profits by way of dividTermination and to apply such sum on their behalf in paying up in full unissued Shares for allotment and distribution credited as fully paid-up to and amongst them in the proportion aforesaid. Authorisation 145. Where any difficulty arises in regard to any distribution under the last preceding Article, the Directors may settle the same as they think expedient and, in particular, may authorise any person to sell and Assignment any fractions or may resolve that the distribution should be as nearly as may be practicable in the correct proportion but not exactly so or may ignore fractions altogether, and may determine that cash payments should be made to any Members in order to adjust the rights of all parties, as may seem expedient to the Directors. The Directors may appoint any person to sign on behalf of the persons entitled to participate in the distribution any contract necessary or desirable for giving effect thereto and such appointment shall be effective and binding upon the Members. 33 SHARE PREMIUM ACCOUNT 146. The Directors shall in accordance with the Law establish a Share Premium Account and shall carry to the credit of such account from time to time a sum equal to the amount or value of the premium paid on the issue of any Share. 147. There shall be debited to any Share Premium Account on the redemption or purchase of a Share the difference between the nominal value of such Share and the redemption or purchase price provided always that at the discretion of the Directors such sum may be paid out of the profits of the Company or, if permitted by the Law, out of capital. ACCOUNTING RECORDS Books of account 148. The Directors shall cause to be kept accounting records sufficient to give a true and fair view of the state of the Company's affairs and to show and explain its transactions and otherwise in accordance with the Law. Inspection by Members 149. The accounting records shall be kept at the Registered Office or at such other place or places as the Directors think fit, and shall at all times be open to inspection by the Directors. No Member (who is not also a Director) shall have any right to inspect any accounting record or book or document of the Company except as conferred by law or authorised by the Directors or by the Members by Ordinary Resolution. Records and audit 150. From time to time the Company in general meeting may determine (or revoke, alter or amTermination any such determination) or, failing such determination, the Directors may determine (or revoke, alter or amTermination any such determination): 150.1 that the accounts of the Company be audited and the appointment of the Auditors; 150.2 that there be prepared and sent to each Member and other person entitled thereto a profit and loss account, a balance sheet, group accounts and/or reports for such period and on such terms as they may determine; and 150.3 that there be laid before the Company in general meeting a copy of every balance sheet together with a copy of the Auditor's report. 34 SERVICE OF NOTICES AND DOCUMENTS Form and delivery of notices 151. Notices or other documents or communications may be given to any Member by the Company either personally or by sTerminationing it by courier, post, fax or email to him to his registered address, or (if he has no registered address) to the address, if any, supplied by him to the Company for the giving of notices to him. Any notice shall be deemed to be effected: 151.1 if delivered personally or sent by courier, by properly addressing and prepaying a letter containing the notice; and to have been effected, in the case of a notice of a meeting, when delivered; 151.2 if sent by post, by properly addressing, prepaying, and posting a letter containing the notice (by airmail if available) and to have been effected, in the case of a notice of a meeting, at the Termination of three days after it was posted; and 151.3 if sent by fax or email by properly addressing and sTerminationing such notice through the appropriate transmitting medium and to have been effected on the day the same is sent. 152. A notice may be given by the Company to the joint holders of a Share by giving the notice to the joint holder named first in the Register of Members in respect of the Share. 153. A notice may be given by the Company to the person entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a Member by sTerminationing it through the post in a prepaid letter addressed to them by name, or by the title of representatives of the deceased, or trustee of the bankrupt, or by any like description, at the address, if any, supplied for the purpose by the persons claiming to be so entitled, or (until such an address has been so supplied) by giving the notice in any manner in which the same might have been given if the death or bankruptcy had not occurred. 154. Notice of every general meeting shall be given in any manner hereinbefore authorised to: 154.1 every Member entitled to vote except those Members entitled to vote who (having no registered address) have not supplied to the Company an address for the giving of notices to them; and 154.2 every person entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a Member, who, but for his death or bankruptcy would be entitled to receive notice of the meeting. 155. No other persons shall be entitled to receive notices of general meeting. 35 WINDING UP Method of winding up 156. Subject to the rights attaching to any Shares, if the Company shall be wound up, the liquidator may, with the sanction of a Special Resolution and any other sanction required by the Law or these Articles, divide amongst the Members in kind the whole or any part of the assets of the Company (whether they shall consist of property of the same kind or not) and may for such purpose set such value as he deems fair upon any property to be divided as aforesaid and may determine how such division shall be carried out as between the Members or different classes of Members. The liquidator may, with the like sanction, vest the whole or any part of such assets in trustees upon such trusts for the benefit of the contributories as the liquidator, with the like sanction, shall think fit, but so that no Member shall be compelled to accept any asset upon which there is any liability. Distribution of assets 157. If the Company shall be wound up and the assets available for distribution amongst the Members as such shall be insufficient to repay the whole of the paid up capital, such assets shall be distributed so that, as nearly as may be, the losses shall be borne by the Members in proportion to the capital paid up, or which ought to have been paid up, at the commencement of the winding up, on the Shares held by them respectively. And if in a winding up the assets available for distribution amongst the Members shall be more than sufficient to repay the whole of the capital paid up at the commencement of the winding up, the excess shall be distributed amongst the Members in proportion to the capital paid up at the commencement of the winding up on the Shares held by them respectively. This Article is to be without prejudice to the rights of the holders of Shares issued upon special terms and conditions. Indemnification Indemnification and limitation of liability 158. Every Indemnified Person shall, in the absence of wilful neglect or default, be indemnified and held harmless out of the assets of the Company against all liabilities, loss, damage, cost or expense (including but not limited to liabilities under contract, tort and statute or any applicable foreign law or regulation and all reasonable legal and other costs and expenses on a full Indemnification basis properly payable) incurred or suffered by him by or by reason of any act done, conceived in or omitted in the conduct of the Company’s business or in the discharge of his duties and the Indemnification contained in this Article shall extTermination to any Indemnified Person acting in any office or trust in the reasonable belief that he has been appointed or elected to such office or trust notwithstanding any defect in such appointment or election. 36 159. No Indemnified Person shall be liable to the Company for acts, defaults or omissions of any other Indemnified Person. Indemnification and reimbursement 160. Every Indemnified Person shall be indemnified out of the funds of the Company against all liabilities incurred by him by or by reason of any act done, conceived in or omitted in the conduct of the Company’s business or in the discharge of his duties in defTerminationing any proceedings, whether civil or criminal, in which judgment is given in his favour, or in which he is acquitted, or in connection with any application in which relief from liability is granted to him by the court. 161. To the extent that any Indemnified Person is entitled to claim an Indemnification pursuant to these Articles in respect of amounts paid or discharged by him, the relative Indemnification shall take effect as an obligation of the Company to reimburse the person making such payment or effecting such discharge. Wilful neglect or default 162. Each Member and the Company agree to waive any claim or right of action he or it may at any time have, whether individually or by or in the right of the Company, against any Indemnified Person on account of any act or omission of such Indemnified Person in the performance of his duties for the Company; provided however, that such waiver shall not apply to any claims or rights of action arising out of the wilful neglect or default of such Indemnified Person or to recover any gain, personal profit or advantage to which such Indemnified Person is not legally entitled. Advance of legal fees 163. Expenses incurred in defTerminationing any civil or criminal action or proceeding for which indemnification is required pursuant to these Articles shall be paid by the Company in advance of the final disposition of such action or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnified Person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that the Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified pursuant to these Articles. Each Member of the Company shall be deemed to have acknowledged and agreed that the advances of funds may be made by the Company as aforesaid, and when made by the Company under this Article are made to meet expTerminationitures incurred for the purpose of enabling such Indemnified Person to properly perform his or her duties to the Company. 37 CONTINUATION 164. The Company shall have the power, subject to the provisions of the Law and with the approval of a Special Resolution, to continue as a body incorporated under the laws of any jurisdiction outside of the Cayman Islands and to be de-registered in the Cayman Islands. AMTerminationMENT OF MEMORANDUM AND ARTICLES Subject to the provisions of the Law, the Company may from time to time by Special Resolution alter or amTermination the Memorandum or these Articles in whole or in part provided that no such amTerminationment shall affect the special rights attaching to any class of Shares without the consent or sanction provided for in these Articles. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Memorandum or in these Articles or in Law, for so long as HLNG is a Member, the Company shall not alter or amTermination the Memorandum or these Articles in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of HLNG 38 SCHEDULE A INSURANCE POLICIES Hull & Material Adverse Effecthinery insurance: All insurances carried, or to be carried, by the owner of the Vessel are placed as part of Höegh LNG’s fleet placements in the international insurance markets.

Every Member shall be entitled, without payment, to a certificate of the Company specifying the Share or Shares held by him and the amount paid up thereon. 13. Notwithstanding the provisions of these Articles, the Directors may resolve not to issue share certificates to Members of the Company. Certificates for jointly-held Shares 14. The Company shall not be bound to issue more than one certificate for Shares held jointly by more than one person, and delivery of a certificate to one joint holder shall be sufficient delivery to all. Replacement Share Certificates 15. If a share certificate is defaced, lost or destroyed, it may be replaced on payment of such fee (if any) and on such terms (if any) as to evidence and Indemnification, and on the payment of expenses of the Company in investigating such evidence and preparing such Indemnification as the Directors shall think fit and, in case of defacement, on delivery of the old certificate to the Company for cancellation. 6 Assignment OF SHARES Instrument of Assignment 16. The instrument of Assignment of any Share shall be executed by or on behalf of the Assignmentor (and, if the Directors so determine, the Assignmentee).

All instruments of Assignment, once registered, may be retained by the Company. 17. Subject to any applicable restrictions contained in these Articles, Shares shall be Assignmentred in any usual or common form approved by the Directors. Refusal to register Assignments 18. The Directors may, in their absolute discretion and without assigning any reason therefore, decline to register any Assignment of any Share.

If the Directors decline to register a Assignment of Shares they shall sTermination notice of the refusal to the Assignmentee within one month after the date on which the Assignment was lodged with the Company. 20. The Directors may also suspTermination the registration of the Assignments at such times and for such periods as the Directors may from time to time determine. TRANSMISSION OF SHARES Transmission of Shares 21. If a Member dies, the survivor or survivors (where he was a joint holder), and the legal personal representative (where he was sole holder), shall be the only person recognised by the Company as having any title to the Share. The estate of a deceased Member is not thereby released from any liability in respect of any Share held by him, whether solely or jointly. For the purpose of this Article, legal personal representative means the person to whom probate or letters of administration has or have been granted in the Cayman Islands or, if there is no such person, such other person as the Directors may in their absolute discretion determine to be the person recognised by the Company for the purpose of this Article. Election by persons entitled on transmission 22. Any person becoming entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a Member or otherwise by operation of Governing Law may elect, upon such evidence being produced as may be required by the Directors as to his entitlement, either be registered himself as a Member in respect of the Share or, instead of being registered himself, to make such Assignment of the Share as the deceased or bankrupt Member could have made. 7 Manner of election 23. If the person so becoming entitled elects to be registered himself, he shall deliver or sTermination to the Company a notice in writing signed by him stating that he so elects. If he shall elect to Assignment the Shares, he shall signify his election by signing an instrument of Assignment of such Shares in favour of his Assignmentee. All the limitations, restrictions and provisions of these Articles relating to the right to Assignment and the registration of Assignments of Shares shall be applicable to any such notice or instrument of Assignment as aforesaid as if the death of the Member or other event giving rise to the transmission had not occurred and the notice or instrument of Assignment was an instrument of Assignment signed by such Member. Rights of persons entitled on transmission 24. A person becoming entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of the Member (or otherwise by operation of Governing Law), upon such evidence being produced as may be required by the Directors as to his entitlement, shall be entitled to the same dividTerminations and other monies payable in respect of the Share as he would be entitled if he were the holder of such Share. However, he shall not be entitled, until he becomes registered as the holder of such Share, to receive notices of or to attTermination or vote at general meetings of the Company or (except as aforesaid) to exercise any other rights or privileges of a Member. The Directors may at any time give notice requiring such person to elect either to be registered himself or to Assignment the Share and, if the notice is not complied with within sixty days, the Directors may thereafter withhold payment of all dividTerminations and other monies payable in respect of the Shares until the requirements of the notice have been complied with. REDEMPTION AND PURCHASE OF SHARES 25. Subject to the provisions of the Law and the Memorandum, the Company may: 25.1 purchase its own Shares (including any redeemable Shares) in such manner and on such terms as the Directors may agree with the relevant Member unless following such purchase there would no longer be any issued Shares and may make payment for such purchase or for any redemption of Shares in any manner authorised by the Law, including out of capital; and 25.2 reduce its share capital and any capital redemption reserve fund in any manner whatsoever. 8 VARIATION OF SHARE RIGHTS Variation of class rights 26. If at any time the share capital is divided into different classes of Shares, all or any of the special rights attached to any class of Shares (unless otherwise provided by the terms of issue of the Shares of that class) may be varied or abrogated with the consent in writing of the holders of not less than two thirds of the issued Shares of that class or with the sanction of a resolution passed by the holders of not less than two thirds of the issued Shares of that class as may be present in person or by proxy at a separate general meeting of the holders of the Shares of that class. To any such separate general meeting, all of the provisions of these Articles relating to general meetings shall mutatis mutandis apply, but so that the necessary quorum shall be any one or more persons holding or representing by proxy not less than one third of the issued Shares of the class and that any holder of Shares of the relevant class present in person or by proxy may demand a poll. Treatment of classes 27. For the purpose of a separate class meeting, the Directors may treat two or more of all classes of Shares as forming one class if they consider that such class of Shares would be affected in the same way by the proposals under consideration. Effect of Share issue on class rights 28. The rights conferred upon the holders of any Shares shall not, unless otherwise expressly provided in the rights attaching to such Shares, be deemed to be altered by the creation or issue of further Shares ranking pari passu therewith. NON-RECOGNITION OF TRUSTS 29. Except as required by the Law or these Articles, or under an order of a court of competent jurisdiction, the Company shall not be bound by or compelled to recognise in any way, even when notice thereof is given to it, any equitable, contingent, future or partial interest in any Share, or any other rights in respect of any Share other than an absolute right to the entirety thereof in the registered holder. 9 LIEN Lien generally 30. The Company shall have a first and paramount lien on every Share (not being a fully paid Share) for all moneys (whether presently payable or not) called or payable at a date fixed by or in accordance with the terms of issue of such Share in respect of that Share, and the Company shall also have a first and paramount lien on every Share (other than a fully paid up Share) standing registered in the name of a Member, whether singly or jointly with any other person for all debts and liabilities of a Member or his estate to the Company, whether the same shall have been incurred before or after notice to the Company of any interest of any person other than such Member, and whether the time for the payment or discharge of the same shall have actually arrived or not, and notwithstanding that the same are joint debts or liabilities of such Member or his estate and any other person, whether a Member or not. The Directors may at any time, either generally or in any particular case, waive any lien that has arisen or declare any Share to be wholly or in part exempt from the provisions of this Article. The Company's lien, if any, on a Share shall extTermination to all dividTerminations payable thereon. Enforcement 31. The Company may sell, in such manner as the Directors think fit, any Share on which the Company has a lien, provided a sum in respect of which the lien exists is presently payable, and is not paid within fourteen days after a notice in writing has been given to the registered holder  for the time being of the Share, demanding payment of the sum presently payable and giving notice of the intention to sell in default of such payment. Completion of sale 32. For giving effect to any such sale, the Directors may authorise any person to Assignment the Share sold to the purchaser thereof. The purchaser shall be registered as the holder of the Share comprised in any such Assignment and he shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money, nor shall his title to the Share be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings relating to the sale. Application of proceeds 33. The net proceeds of such sale shall be applied in payment or discharge of the debt or liability in respect of which the lien exists and as is presently payable, and any balance shall (subject to a like lien for debts or liabilities not presently payable as existed upon the Shares prior to the sale) be paid to the person who was the registered holder of the Share immediately before such sale. CALLS ON SHARES Calls on Shares generally 34. The Directors may from time to time make calls upon the Members in respect of any moneys unpaid on their Shares (whether in respect of the par value of the Shares or premium or otherwise and not, by the terms of issue thereof, made payable at a future date fixed by or in accordance with such terms of issue); and each Member shall (subject to the Company serving upon him at least 14 days’ notice specifying the time or times and place of payment) pay to the Company at the time or times and place so specified the amount called on his Shares. A call may be revoked or postponed by the Directors wholly or in part as the Directors may determine. A call shall be deemed to have been made at the time when the resolution of the Directors authorising the call was passed. 10 Payment 35. Payment of a call may be made by instalments on the direction of the Directors. 36. If a sum called in respect of a Share is not paid before or on the day appointed for payment thereof, the person from whom the sum is due shall pay interest on the sum from the day payment is due to the time of the actual payment at such rate as the Directors may determine, but the Directors may waive payment of such interest wholly or in part. 37. Any sum payable in respect of a Share on issue or allotment or at any fixed date, whether in respect of the par value of the Share or premium or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a call and if it is not paid all the relevant provisions as to payment of interest, forfeiture or otherwise of these Articles shall apply as if such sum had become due and payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified. 38. The Directors may issue Shares with different terms as to the amount and times of payment of calls. Liability of joint holders 39. The joint holders of a Share shall be jointly and severally liable to pay calls in respect thereof. Interest 40. The Directors may, if they think fit, receive from any Member willing to advance the same, all or any part of the moneys uncalled and unpaid upon any Shares held by him; and may (until the amount would otherwise become payable) pay interest at such rate (not exceeding six per cent without the sanction of the Company in general meeting) as may be agreed upon between the Member paying the sum in advance and the Directors. FORFEITURE OF SHARES Notice 41. If a Member fails to pay any call or instalment of a call by the date it becomes due and payable, the Directors may, at any time thereafter while such call or instalment remains unpaid, give notice to the Member requiring payment of the unpaid portion of the call or instalment, together with any accrued interest and expenses incurred by the Company by reason of such non-payment. 11 42. The notice shall specify where and by what date (not being less than the Termination of 14 days’ from the date of the notice) payment is to be made and shall state that if it is not complied with the Shares in respect of which the call was made will be liable to be forfeited. The Directors may accept the surrTerminationer of any Share liable to be forfeited hereunder and, in such case, references to these Articles to forfeiture shall include surrTerminationer. Forfeiture for non-compliance 43. If such notice is not complied with, any Share in respect of which the notice was given may thereafter, before the payment of all calls or instalments and interest due in respect thereof has been made, be forfeited by a resolution of the Directors. Such forfeiture shall include all dividTerminations declared, other distributions or other monies payable in respect of the forfeited Shares and not paid before the forfeiture. Forfeited Shares 44. A forfeited Share may be sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed of upon such terms and in such manner as the Directors shall think fit, and at any time before a sale, re-allotment or disposition, the forfeiture may be cancelled on such terms as the Directors think fit. Continued liability for forfeited Member 45. A person whose Shares have been forfeited shall cease to be a Member in respect of the forfeited Shares, but shall remain liable to pay to the Company all moneys which at the date of forfeiture were presently payable by him in respect of the Shares together with interest at such rate as the Directors may determine from the date of forfeiture until payment, but his liability shall cease if and when the Company receives payment in full of all amounts due in respect of the Shares. The Company may enforce payment without being under any obligation to make any allowance for the value of the Shares forfeited. Evidence of forfeiture 46. An affidavit in writing by a Director or Secretary of the Company that a Share has been duly forfeited on a specified date, shall be conclusive evidence of the facts stated in it as against all persons claiming to be entitled to the Share. The Company may receive the consideration, if any, given for the Share on any sale, re-allotment or disposition thereof and may authorise some person to execute a Assignment of the Share in favour of the person to whom the Share is sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed of, and he shall thereupon be registered as the holder of the Share, and shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money (if any) nor shall his title to the Share be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings in reference to the forfeiture, sale, re-allotment or disposition of the Share. 12 47. The provisions of these Articles as to forfeiture shall apply in the case of non-payment of any sum which, by the terms of issue of a Share, becomes payable at a fixed time, whether on account of the par value of the Share, or by way of premium or otherwise, as if the same had been made payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified to the Member. INCREASE OF CAPITAL 48. The Company may from time to time by Ordinary Resolution increase its share capital by such sum, to be divided into new Shares of such par value, and with such rights, priorities and privileges attached thereto as the resolution shall prescribe. 49. Subject to any directions given by the Company in a general meeting, all new Shares shall be at the disposal of the Directors in accordance with these Articles. 50. The new Shares shall be subject to the same provisions of these Articles with reference to the payment of calls, lien, forfeiture, Assignment, transmission and otherwise, as the Shares in the original share capital. ALTERATION OF CAPITAL 51. The Company may from time to time by Ordinary Resolution: 51.1 consolidate and divide all or any of its share capital into Shares of larger par value than its existing Shares; 51.2 sub divide its existing Shares, or any of them, into Shares of smaller par value than is fixed by the Memorandum, subject nevertheless to the provisions of section 13 of the Law; 51.3 cancel any Shares which, at the date of the passing of the resolution, have not been taken or agreed to be taken by any person; and 51.4 convert all or any paid up Shares into stock, and reconvert all or any stock into paid up Shares of any denomination. 52. The Company may from time to time by Special Resolution: 52.1 divide its Shares into several classes and attach to such classes any preferential, deferred, or special rights or restrictions in accordance with these Articles; 52.2 change the currency denomination of its share capital; 13 52.3 reduce its share capital and any capital redemption reserve fund in any manner whatsoever; and 52.4 merge or consolidate with any one or more constituent companies (as defined in the Law). GENERAL MEETINGS Convening a meeting 53. The Directors may, whenever they think fit, convene an extraordinary general meeting. If at any time there are not sufficient Directors capable of acting to form a quorum, any Director, or any one or more Members holding in the aggregate not less than one third of the total issued share capital of the Company entitled to vote, may convene an extraordinary general meeting in the same manner as nearly as possible as that in which meetings may be convened by the Directors. Members’ requisition 54. The Directors shall, upon the requisition in writing of one or more Members holding in the aggregate not less than one tenth of such paid up capital of the Company as at the date of the requisition carries the right of voting at general meetings, convene an extraordinary general meeting. Any such requisition shall express the object of the meeting proposed to be called, and must be signed by the requisitionists and deposited at the Registered Office, and may consist of several documents in like form, each signed by one or more requisitionists. 55.

Every notice shall specify the place, the day and the time of meeting and, in the case of special business, the general nature of the business to be conducted at the general meeting, and shall be given in the manner provided in these Articles or in such other manner (if any) as may be prescribed by the Company, to such persons as are entitled to receive such notices from the Company. A general meeting may be convened by such shorter notice, or without notice, by a majority in number of the Members having the right to attTermination and vote at the meeting, being a majority together holding not less than ninety-five percent in nominal value of the Shares giving that right. 14 Omission or non-receipt 57.

PROCEEDINGS AT GENERAL MEETINGS 58. All business shall be deemed special that is transacted at an extraordinary general meeting. Quorum 59. No business shall be transacted at any general meeting unless a quorum of Members is present at the time that the meeting proceeds to business, but the absence of a quorum shall not preclude the appointment, choice or election of a chairman, which shall not be treated as part of the business of the Meeting. Save as herein otherwise provided, one or more Members holding in the aggregate not less than one third of the total issued share capital of the Company present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall be a quorum. Adjournment for lack of quorum 60. If within five minutes (or such longer time as the chairman of the meeting may determine to wait) after the time appointed for the meeting, a quorum is not present, the meeting, if convened upon the requisition of Members, shall be dissolved. In any other case, it shall stand adjourned to the same day in the next week, at the same time and place, and if at the adjourned meeting a quorum is not present within half an hour from the time appointed for the meeting, the Members present shall be a quorum. Meeting by telephone or other facilities 61. A meeting of the Members may be held by telephone, electronic or other communication facilities (including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, by telephone or video conferencing) by which all persons participating in the meeting can communicate with each other simultaneously and instantaneously, and participation in such a general meeting shall constitute presence in person at such meeting. 62. Any Director shall be entitled to attTermination and speak at any general meeting of the Company. 15 Appointment of chairman 63. The chairman (if any) of the Board of Directors shall preside as chairman at every general meeting of the Company.

If no Director is present, or if each of the Directors present declines to take the chair, the Members present and entitled to vote shall elect one of their number to be chairman. Adjournment of meeting 64. The chairman may, with the consent of a meeting at which a quorum is present (and shall if so directed by the meeting) adjourn the meeting from time to time and from place to place, but no business shall be transacted at any adjourned meeting other than the business left unfinished at the meeting from which the adjournment took place. When a meeting is adjourned for ten days or more, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given as in the case of an original meeting. Save as aforesaid, it shall not be necessary to give any notice of an adjournment or of the business to be transacted at an adjourned meeting. VOTING Ordinary Resolution Save where a Special Resolution or other greater majority is required by the Law or these Articles, any question proposed for consideration at any general meeting shall be decided by an Ordinary Resolution. Voting on a show of hands 65. At any general meeting, a resolution put to the vote of the meeting shall be decided on a show of hands, unless before or on the declaration of the result of the show of hands, or on the withdrawal of any other demand for a poll. Demand for poll 66. A poll is demanded by: 66.1 the chairman of the meeting; or 66.2 at least three Members present in person or by proxy; or 66.3 any Member or Members present in person or by proxy and holding collectively not less than one tenth of the total voting rights of all the Members having the right to vote at such meeting; or 16 66.4 a Member or Members present in person or by proxy holding Shares conferring the right to vote at such meeting, being Shares on which an aggregate sum has been paid up equal to not less than one tenth of the total sum paid up on all such Shares conferring such right. 67. Unless a poll is duly demanded and the demand is not withdrawn, a declaration by the chairman that a resolution has, on a show of hands, been carried or carried unanimously, or by a particular majority, or lost and an entry to that effect in the minutes of the proceedings of the Company shall be conclusive evidence of that fact, without proof of the number or proportion of the votes recorded in favour of, or against, that resolution. The demand for a poll may be withdrawn by the person or any persons making it at any time prior to the declaration of the result of the poll. 68. If a poll is duly demanded, it shall be taken in such manner as the chairman directs, and the result of the poll shall be deemed to be the resolution of the meeting at which the poll was demanded. 69. In the case of an equality of votes at a general meeting, whether on a show of hands or on a poll, the chairman of the meeting at which the show of hands takes place or at which the poll is demanded, shall not be entitled to a second or casting vote and the resolution shall fail. 70. A poll demanded on the election of a chairman or on a question of adjournment shall be taken forthwith. A poll demanded on any other question shall be taken in such manner and either forthwith or at such time later in the meeting as the chairman of the meeting shall direct. 71. The demand for a poll shall not prevent the continuance of a meeting for the transaction of any business other than the question on which the poll has been demanded and it may be withdrawn at any time before the close of the meeting or the taking of the poll, whichever is the earlier. Voting on a poll 72. On a poll votes may be cast either personally or by proxy. 73. A person entitled to more than one vote on a poll need not use all his votes or cast all the votes he uses in the same way. 74. On a show of hands, every Member present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall have one vote. On a poll, every Member present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall have one vote for each Share of which he is the registered holder. 17 75. In the case of joint holders of a Share, the vote of the senior who tTerminationers a vote, whether in person or by proxy, shall be accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint holders; and for this purpose seniority shall be determined by the order in which the names stand in the Register of Members in respect of the joint holding. 76. A Member of unsound mind, or, in respect of whom an order has been made by any court having jurisdiction in lunacy, may vote, whether on a show of hands or on a poll, by his receiver, committee, curator bonis or other person of similar nature appointed by such court, and any such receiver, committee, curator bonis or other person may vote by proxy and may otherwise act and be treated as such Member for the purpose of the general meetings. 77. No Member, unless the Directors otherwise determine, shall be entitled to vote at any general meeting, unless all calls or other sums presently payable by him in respect of Shares in the Company have been paid. 78. No objection shall be raised as to the qualification of any voter or as to whether any votes have been properly counted except at the general meeting or adjourned general meeting at which the vote objected to is given or tTerminationered and every vote not disallowed at the meeting shall be valid. Any objection made in due time and in accordance with these Articles shall be referred to the chairman whose decision shall be final and conclusive. Shareholder Restricted Matters 78A.

The Directors may elect a chairman of their meetings and determine the period for which he is to hold office; but if no such chairman is elected, or if at any meeting the chairman is not present within five minutes after the time appointed for holding the same, the Directors present may choose one of their number to be chairman of the meeting. Written resolutions of Directors 109. A resolution in writing signed by all of the Directors or all of the members of a committee of Directors for the time being entitled to receive notice of a meeting of the Directors (or by an alternate Director as provided in these Articles), including a resolution signed in counterpart and/or sent or evidenced by way of signed fax or electronic transmission, shall be as valid and effectual as if it had been passed at a meeting of the Directors or of a committee of Directors duly called and constituted. Meeting by telephone or other facilities 110. To the extent permitted by law, a meeting of the Directors or a committee appointed by the Directors may be held by means of such telephone, electronic or other communication facilities (including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, by telephone or by video conferencing) as permit all persons participating in the meeting to communicate with each other simultaneously and instantaneously and participation in such a meeting shall constitute presence in person at such meeting. Such a meeting shall be deemed to take place where the largest group of those Directors participating in the meeting is physically assembled, or, if there is no such group, where the chairman of the meeting then is. Validity of acts in spite of defect 111. All acts done by any meeting of the Directors or of a committee of Directors, or by any person acting as a Director shall, notwithstanding that it be afterwards discovered that there was some defect in the appointment of any such Director or person acting as aforesaid, or that they or any of them were disqualified, be as valid as if every such person had been duly appointed and was qualified to be a Director. Minutes 112. The Directors shall cause minutes to be made and records kept for the purpose of recording: 26 112.1 all appointments of officers made by the Directors; 112.2 the names of the Directors and other persons present at each meeting of the Directors and of any committee of the Directors; and 112.3 all resolutions and proceedings at all meetings of the Members of the Company or any class of Members and of the Directors and of committees of Directors; and the chairman of all such meetings or of any meeting confirming the minutes thereof shall sign the same. DIRECTORS’ INTERESTS 113. A Director may hold any other office or place of profit with the Company (except that of Auditor) in conjunction with his office of Director for such period and upon such terms as to remuneration and otherwise as the Directors may determine. 114. A Director or officer may act by himself or his firm in a professional capacity for the Company (otherwise than as Auditor), and he or his firm shall be entitled to remuneration for professional services as if he were not a Director or officer. 115. No Director or officer shall be disqualified from his office or prevented by such office from holding any office or place of profit under the Company or under any company in which the Company shall be a Member or have any interest, or from contracting with the Company, either as vTerminationor, purchaser or otherwise, nor shall any such contract or any contract or transaction entered into by or on behalf of the Company in which any Director or officer shall be in any way interested be or be liable to be avoided nor shall any Director or officer so contracting, dealing or being so interested be liable to account to the Company for any profit realised by any such contract or transaction by reason of such Director holding office or of the fiduciary relation thereby established. Disclosure and nature of interest 116. A Director (or his alternate Director in his absence) shall be at liberty to vote in respect of any contract or transaction in which he is interested provided that the nature of the interest of the Director in any such contract or transaction shall be disclosed by him at or prior to its consideration and any vote thereon. 117. The nature of the interest of any Director or officer in any contract, dealing or transacting with or affecting the Company shall be disclosed by him at or prior to its consideration and any vote thereon and a general notice that a Director or officer is a shareholder of any specified firm or company and/or is to be regarded as interested in any transaction with such firm or company shall be sufficient disclosure hereunder and after such general notice it shall not be necessary to give special notice relating to any particular transaction. 27 DELEGATION OF DIRECTORS’ POWERS Power to delegate 118. Directors may from time to time and at any time by power of attorney or otherwise appoint any company, firm or person or fluctuating body of persons, whether nominated directly or indirectly by the Directors, to be the attorney or attorneys of the Company for such purposes and with such powers, authorities and discretions (not exceeding those vested in or exercisable by the Directors under these Articles) and for such period and subject to such conditions as they may think fit, and any such power of attorney may contain such provisions for the protection and convenience of persons dealing with any such attorney and of such attorney as the Directors may think fit and may also authorise any such attorney to delegate all or any of the powers, authorities and discretions vested in him. 119. The Directors may delegate any of the powers exercisable by them to a Managing Director , Director or any other person or persons acting individually or jointly as they may from time to time by resolution appoint upon such terms and conditions and with such restrictions as they may think fit, and may from time to time by resolution revoke, withdraw, alter or vary all or any such powers. Alternate Directors 120. Any Director may by writing appoint any other Director, or other person willing to act, to be his alternate and remove his alternate so appointed by him. Such appointment or removal shall be by notice to the Registered Office signed by the Director making or revoking the appointment or in any other manner approved by the Directors, and shall be effective on the date the notice is served and the alternate shall be notified of such appointment or revocation. Subject to the removal by the appointing Director, the alternate shall continue in office until the date on which his appointor ceases to be a Director. An alternate may also be a Director in his own right and may act as alternate to more than one Director. 121. An alternate shall be entitled to receive notice of all meetings of the Directors, attTermination, be counted in the quorum, vote and act in such appointor’s place at every such meeting at which the appointing Director is not personally present, and generally to perform all the functions of his appointor as a Director in his absence. 122. These Articles (except as regards powers to appoint an alternate and remuneration) apply equally to the alternate as though he were the Director in his own right. 123. An alternate Director shall be deemed for all purposes to be a Director and shall alone be responsible for his own acts and defaults and shall not be deemed to be the agent of the Director appointing him. The signature of an alternate to any resolution in writing of the Director or a committee there shall, unless the terms of the appointment provides to the contrary, be as effective as the signature of the Director or Directors to whom he is alternate. 28 Committees of Directors 124. The Directors may delegate any of their powers to committees consisting of such member or members of their body as they think fit; any committee so formed shall, in the exercise of the powers so delegated, conform to any regulations that may be imposed on it by the Directors. 125. A committee may elect a chairman of its meetings; if no such chairman is elected, or if at any meeting the chairman is not present within five minutes after the time appointed for holding the same, the members present may choose one of their number to be chairman of the meeting. 126. A committee may meet and adjourn as it thinks proper. Questions arising at any meeting shall be determined by a majority of votes of the members present and in case of an equality of votes the chairman shall not have a second or casting vote and the motion shall be deemed to have been lost. Officers 127. The Directors may appoint a Secretary and such other officers as they may from time to time consider necessary upon such terms as to duration of office, remuneration and otherwise as they may think fit. Such Secretary or other officers need not be Directors and in the case of the other officers may be ascribed such titles as the Directors may decide and the Directors may revoke or terminate any such election or appointment. Any such revocation or termination shall be without prejudice to any claim for any damages that such officer may have against the Company or the Company may have against such officer for any breach of any contract of service between him and the Company which may be involved in such revocation or termination. Save as provided in the Law or these Articles, the powers and duties of the officers of the Company shall be such (if any) as are determined from time to time by the Directors. DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION Remuneration 128. The remuneration to be paid to the Directors, if any, shall be determined by the Company in general meeting or, in the absence of such a determination, by the Directors. Expenses 129. Each Director shall also be entitled to be paid his reasonable travelling, hotel and other expenses properly incurred by him in connection with his attTerminationance at meetings of the Directors, committees of the Directors or general meetings of the Company, or otherwise in connection with the business of the Company, or to receive a fixed allowance in respect thereof as may be determined by the Directors, or a combination partly of one such method and partly the other. 29 Additional remuneration 130. The Directors may by resolution approve additional remuneration to any Director for services which in the opinion of the Directors go beyond the ordinary duties of a Director, and such extra remuneration shall be in addition to any remuneration provided for, by or pursuant to any other Article. SEALS AND DEEDS Use of Seal 131. The Directors may determine that the Company shall have a Seal, and if they so determine, shall provide for the safe custody of the Seal. The Seal shall only be used by the authority of the Directors and in the presence of a Director or the Secretary or such other person as the Directors may by resolution appoint for this purpose, and every instrument to which the Seal affixed shall be signed by the relevant person. Notwithstanding the above, annual returns and notices filed under the Law may be executed either as a deed or under Seal and in either case without the need for the authority of a resolution of the Directors. 30 Duplicate Seal 132. The Company may maintain in any place or places outside the Cayman Islands a facsimile of any Seal and such facsimile seal shall be affixed in the same way as if it were the Seal. Execution of deeds 133. In accordance with the Law, the Company may execute any deed or other instrument (which would otherwise be required to be executed under Seal) by the signature of such deed or instrument as a deed by a Director or by the Secretary of the Company or by such other person as the Directors may appoint or by any other person or attorney on behalf of the Company appointed by a deed or other instrument executed as a deed by a Director or the Secretary or such other person as aforesaid. DIVIDTerminationS Payment of DividTerminations 134. The Directors may from time to time declare dividTerminations to be paid to the Members according to their rights and interests, including such interim dividTerminations as appear to the Directors to be justified by the position of the Company. The Directors may also pay any fixed cash dividTermination which is payable on any Shares of the Company half yearly or on such other dates, whenever the position of the Company, in the opinion of the Directors, justifies such payment. 135. No dividTermination shall be paid otherwise than out of profits or out of monies otherwise available for dividTermination in accordance with the Law. Calculation of DividTerminations 136. Subject to the rights of Members, if any, entitled to Shares with special rights as to dividTerminations, all dividTerminations shall be declared and paid according to the amount paid up on the Shares in respect of which the dividTermination is paid and any dividTermination on any class of Shares not fully paid shall be declared and paid according to the amounts paid on the Shares of that class, but if and so long as nothing is paid up on any of the Shares in the Company, dividTerminations may be declared and paid according to the number of Shares. No amount paid on a Share in advance of calls shall, while carrying interest, be treated for the purposes of this Article as paid on the Share. DividTerminations may be apportioned and paid pro rata according to the amounts paid-up on the Shares during any portion or portions of the period in respect of which the dividTermination is paid. 31 Deductions 137. The Directors may deduct from any dividTermination, distribution or other monies payable to a Member by the Company on or in respect of any Shares all sums of money (if any) presently payable by him to the Company on account of calls or otherwise in respect of Shares of the Company. Joint Holders 138. If several persons are registered as joint holders of any Share, any of them may give effectual receipts for any dividTermination or other money payable on or in respect of the Share. Payment method 139. Any dividTermination may be paid by cheque or warrant sent through the post to the address of the Member or person entitled thereto in the Register of Members or, in the case of joint holders addressed to the holder whose name stands first in the Register of Members in respect of the Shares at his registered address as appearing on the Register of Members or to such person and such address as the Member or person entitled or such joint holders as the case may be may direct in writing. Every such cheque or warrant shall, unless the holder or joint holders may in writing direct, be made payable to the order of the person to whom it is sent or to the order of the holder or, in the case of joint holders, to the order of the holder whose name stands first in the Register of Members in respect of such Shares, and shall be sent at his or their risk and payment of the cheque or warrant by the bank on which it is drawn shall constitute a good discharge to the Company. Any one of two or more joint holders may give effectual receipts for any dividTerminations, distributions or other monies payable or property distributable in respect of the Shares held by such joint holders. Satisfaction by distribution of specific assets 140. The Directors may declare that any dividTermination or distribution is paid wholly or partly by the distribution of specific assets and, in particular, of paid up shares, debentures or debenture stock of any other company or in any one or more of such ways, and where any difficulty arises in regard to such dividTermination or distribution, the Directors may settle the same as they think expedient, and in particular may issue fractional Shares or ignore fractions altogether and may fix the value for dividTermination or distribution of such specific assets or any part thereof and may determine that cash payments shall be made to any Members upon the basis of the value so fixed in order to secure equality of distribution, and may vest any such specific assets in trustees as may seem expedient to the Directors. 32 No interest 141. No dividTermination or other distribution or other monies payable by the Company on or in respect of any Share shall bear interest against the Company. Unclaimed dividTerminations 142. All unclaimed dividTerminations or distributions may be invested or otherwise made use of by the Directors for the benefit of the Company until claimed. Any dividTermination or distribution unclaimed by a Member six years after the dividTermination or distribution payment date shall be forfeited and revert to the Company. RESERVES 143. The Directors may, before declaring any dividTermination or distribution, set aside such sums as they think proper as a reserve or reserves which shall, at the discretion of the Directors, be applicable for meeting contingencies, or for equalising dividTerminations, or for any other purpose of the Company, and pTerminationing such application may, in their discretion, be employed in the business of the Company or be invested in such manner as the Directors may from time to time think fit. The Directors may also without placing the same to reserve carry forward any sums which they think it prudent not to distribute. CAPITALISATION OF PROFITS Capitalisation 144. The Directors may capitalise any sum standing to the credit of any of the Company’s reserve accounts which are available for distribution (including its Share Premium Account and capital redemption reserve fund, subject to the Law) or any sum standing to the credit of the profit and loss account or otherwise available for distribution and to appropriate such sums to Members in the proportions in which such sum would have been divisible amongst them had the same been a distribution of profits by way of dividTermination and to apply such sum on their behalf in paying up in full unissued Shares for allotment and distribution credited as fully paid-up to and amongst them in the proportion aforesaid. Authorisation 145. Where any difficulty arises in regard to any distribution under the last preceding Article, the Directors may settle the same as they think expedient and, in particular, may authorise any person to sell and Assignment any fractions or may resolve that the distribution should be as nearly as may be practicable in the correct proportion but not exactly so or may ignore fractions altogether, and may determine that cash payments should be made to any Members in order to adjust the rights of all parties, as may seem expedient to the Directors. The Directors may appoint any person to sign on behalf of the persons entitled to participate in the distribution any contract necessary or desirable for giving effect thereto and such appointment shall be effective and binding upon the Members. 33 SHARE PREMIUM ACCOUNT 146. The Directors shall in accordance with the Law establish a Share Premium Account and shall carry to the credit of such account from time to time a sum equal to the amount or value of the premium paid on the issue of any Share. 147. There shall be debited to any Share Premium Account on the redemption or purchase of a Share the difference between the nominal value of such Share and the redemption or purchase price provided always that at the discretion of the Directors such sum may be paid out of the profits of the Company or, if permitted by the Law, out of capital. ACCOUNTING RECORDS Books of account 148. The Directors shall cause to be kept accounting records sufficient to give a true and fair view of the state of the Company's affairs and to show and explain its transactions and otherwise in accordance with the Law. Inspection by Members 149. The accounting records shall be kept at the Registered Office or at such other place or places as the Directors think fit, and shall at all times be open to inspection by the Directors. No Member (who is not also a Director) shall have any right to inspect any accounting record or book or document of the Company except as conferred by law or authorised by the Directors or by the Members by Ordinary Resolution. Records and audit 150. From time to time the Company in general meeting may determine (or revoke, alter or amTermination any such determination) or, failing such determination, the Directors may determine (or revoke, alter or amTermination any such determination): 150.1 that the accounts of the Company be audited and the appointment of the Auditors; 150.2 that there be prepared and sent to each Member and other person entitled thereto a profit and loss account, a balance sheet, group accounts and/or reports for such period and on such terms as they may determine; and 150.3 that there be laid before the Company in general meeting a copy of every balance sheet together with a copy of the Auditor's report. 34 SERVICE OF NOTICES AND DOCUMENTS Form and delivery of notices 151. Notices or other documents or communications may be given to any Member by the Company either personally or by sTerminationing it by courier, post, fax or email to him to his registered address, or (if he has no registered address) to the address, if any, supplied by him to the Company for the giving of notices to him. Any notice shall be deemed to be effected: 151.1 if delivered personally or sent by courier, by properly addressing and prepaying a letter containing the notice; and to have been effected, in the case of a notice of a meeting, when delivered; 151.2 if sent by post, by properly addressing, prepaying, and posting a letter containing the notice (by airmail if available) and to have been effected, in the case of a notice of a meeting, at the Termination of three days after it was posted; and 151.3 if sent by fax or email by properly addressing and sTerminationing such notice through the appropriate transmitting medium and to have been effected on the day the same is sent. 152. A notice may be given by the Company to the joint holders of a Share by giving the notice to the joint holder named first in the Register of Members in respect of the Share. 153. A notice may be given by the Company to the person entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a Member by sTerminationing it through the post in a prepaid letter addressed to them by name, or by the title of representatives of the deceased, or trustee of the bankrupt, or by any like description, at the address, if any, supplied for the purpose by the persons claiming to be so entitled, or (until such an address has been so supplied) by giving the notice in any manner in which the same might have been given if the death or bankruptcy had not occurred. 154. Notice of every general meeting shall be given in any manner hereinbefore authorised to: 154.1 every Member entitled to vote except those Members entitled to vote who (having no registered address) have not supplied to the Company an address for the giving of notices to them; and 154.2 every person entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a Member, who, but for his death or bankruptcy would be entitled to receive notice of the meeting. 155. No other persons shall be entitled to receive notices of general meeting. 35 WINDING UP Method of winding up 156. Subject to the rights attaching to any Shares, if the Company shall be wound up, the liquidator may, with the sanction of a Special Resolution and any other sanction required by the Law or these Articles, divide amongst the Members in kind the whole or any part of the assets of the Company (whether they shall consist of property of the same kind or not) and may for such purpose set such value as he deems fair upon any property to be divided as aforesaid and may determine how such division shall be carried out as between the Members or different classes of Members. The liquidator may, with the like sanction, vest the whole or any part of such assets in trustees upon such trusts for the benefit of the contributories as the liquidator, with the like sanction, shall think fit, but so that no Member shall be compelled to accept any asset upon which there is any liability. Distribution of assets 157. If the Company shall be wound up and the assets available for distribution amongst the Members as such shall be insufficient to repay the whole of the paid up capital, such assets shall be distributed so that, as nearly as may be, the losses shall be borne by the Members in proportion to the capital paid up, or which ought to have been paid up, at the commencement of the winding up, on the Shares held by them respectively. And if in a winding up the assets available for distribution amongst the Members shall be more than sufficient to repay the whole of the capital paid up at the commencement of the winding up, the excess shall be distributed amongst the Members in proportion to the capital paid up at the commencement of the winding up on the Shares held by them respectively. This Article is to be without prejudice to the rights of the holders of Shares issued upon special terms and conditions. Indemnification Indemnification and limitation of liability 158. Every Indemnified Person shall, in the absence of wilful neglect or default, be indemnified and held harmless out of the assets of the Company against all liabilities, loss, damage, cost or expense (including but not limited to liabilities under contract, tort and statute or any applicable foreign law or regulation and all reasonable legal and other costs and expenses on a full Indemnification basis properly payable) incurred or suffered by him by or by reason of any act done, conceived in or omitted in the conduct of the Company’s business or in the discharge of his duties and the Indemnification contained in this Article shall extTermination to any Indemnified Person acting in any office or trust in the reasonable belief that he has been appointed or elected to such office or trust notwithstanding any defect in such appointment or election. 36 159. No Indemnified Person shall be liable to the Company for acts, defaults or omissions of any other Indemnified Person. Indemnification and reimbursement 160. Every Indemnified Person shall be indemnified out of the funds of the Company against all liabilities incurred by him by or by reason of any act done, conceived in or omitted in the conduct of the Company’s business or in the discharge of his duties in defTerminationing any proceedings, whether civil or criminal, in which judgment is given in his favour, or in which he is acquitted, or in connection with any application in which relief from liability is granted to him by the court. 161. To the extent that any Indemnified Person is entitled to claim an Indemnification pursuant to these Articles in respect of amounts paid or discharged by him, the relative Indemnification shall take effect as an obligation of the Company to reimburse the person making such payment or effecting such discharge. Wilful neglect or default 162. Each Member and the Company agree to waive any claim or right of action he or it may at any time have, whether individually or by or in the right of the Company, against any Indemnified Person on account of any act or omission of such Indemnified Person in the performance of his duties for the Company; provided however, that such waiver shall not apply to any claims or rights of action arising out of the wilful neglect or default of such Indemnified Person or to recover any gain, personal profit or advantage to which such Indemnified Person is not legally entitled. Advance of legal fees 163. Expenses incurred in defTerminationing any civil or criminal action or proceeding for which indemnification is required pursuant to these Articles shall be paid by the Company in advance of the final disposition of such action or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnified Person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that the Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified pursuant to these Articles. Each Member of the Company shall be deemed to have acknowledged and agreed that the advances of funds may be made by the Company as aforesaid, and when made by the Company under this Article are made to meet expTerminationitures incurred for the purpose of enabling such Indemnified Person to properly perform his or her duties to the Company. 37 CONTINUATION 164. The Company shall have the power, subject to the provisions of the Law and with the approval of a Special Resolution, to continue as a body incorporated under the laws of any jurisdiction outside of the Cayman Islands and to be de-registered in the Cayman Islands. AMTerminationMENT OF MEMORANDUM AND ARTICLES Subject to the provisions of the Law, the Company may from time to time by Special Resolution alter or amTermination the Memorandum or these Articles in whole or in part provided that no such amTerminationment shall affect the special rights attaching to any class of Shares without the consent or sanction provided for in these Articles. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Memorandum or in these Articles or in Law, for so long as HLNG is a Member, the Company shall not alter or amTermination the Memorandum or these Articles in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of HLNG 38 SCHEDULE A INSURANCE POLICIES Hull & Material Adverse Effecthinery insurance: All insurances carried, or to be carried, by the owner of the Vessel are placed as part of Höegh LNG’s fleet placements in the international insurance markets.

If a share certificate is defaced, lost or destroyed, it may be replaced on payment of such fee (if any) and on such terms (if any) as to evidence and Indemnification, and on the payment of expenses of the Company in investigating such evidence and preparing such Indemnification as the Directors shall think fit and, in case of defacement, on delivery of the old certificate to the Company for cancellation. 6 Assignment OF SHARES Instrument of Assignment 16. The instrument of Assignment of any Share shall be executed by or on behalf of the Assignmentor (and, if the Directors so determine, the Assignmentee). The Assignmentor shall be deemed to remain the holder of the Share until the name of the Assignmentee is entered in the Register of Members in respect of such Share. All instruments of Assignment, once registered, may be retained by the Company. 17. Subject to any applicable restrictions contained in these Articles, Shares shall be Assignmentred in any usual or common form approved by the Directors. Refusal to register Assignments 18. The Directors may, in their absolute discretion and without assigning any reason therefore, decline to register any Assignment of any Share. The Directors may require reasonable evidence to show the right of the Assignmentor to make the Assignment. 19. If the Directors decline to register a Assignment of Shares they shall sTermination notice of the refusal to the Assignmentee within one month after the date on which the Assignment was lodged with the Company. 20. The Directors may also suspTermination the registration of the Assignments at such times and for such periods as the Directors may from time to time determine. TRANSMISSION OF SHARES Transmission of Shares 21. If a Member dies, the survivor or survivors (where he was a joint holder), and the legal personal representative (where he was sole holder), shall be the only person recognised by the Company as having any title to the Share. The estate of a deceased Member is not thereby released from any liability in respect of any Share held by him, whether solely or jointly. For the purpose of this Article, legal personal representative means the person to whom probate or letters of administration has or have been granted in the Cayman Islands or, if there is no such person, such other person as the Directors may in their absolute discretion determine to be the person recognised by the Company for the purpose of this Article. Election by persons entitled on transmission 22. Any person becoming entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a Member or otherwise by operation of Governing Law may elect, upon such evidence being produced as may be required by the Directors as to his entitlement, either be registered himself as a Member in respect of the Share or, instead of being registered himself, to make such Assignment of the Share as the deceased or bankrupt Member could have made. 7 Manner of election 23. If the person so becoming entitled elects to be registered himself, he shall deliver or sTermination to the Company a notice in writing signed by him stating that he so elects. If he shall elect to Assignment the Shares, he shall signify his election by signing an instrument of Assignment of such Shares in favour of his Assignmentee. All the limitations, restrictions and provisions of these Articles relating to the right to Assignment and the registration of Assignments of Shares shall be applicable to any such notice or instrument of Assignment as aforesaid as if the death of the Member or other event giving rise to the transmission had not occurred and the notice or instrument of Assignment was an instrument of Assignment signed by such Member. Rights of persons entitled on transmission 24. A person becoming entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of the Member (or otherwise by operation of Governing Law), upon such evidence being produced as may be required by the Directors as to his entitlement, shall be entitled to the same dividTerminations and other monies payable in respect of the Share as he would be entitled if he were the holder of such Share. However, he shall not be entitled, until he becomes registered as the holder of such Share, to receive notices of or to attTermination or vote at general meetings of the Company or (except as aforesaid) to exercise any other rights or privileges of a Member. The Directors may at any time give notice requiring such person to elect either to be registered himself or to Assignment the Share and, if the notice is not complied with within sixty days, the Directors may thereafter withhold payment of all dividTerminations and other monies payable in respect of the Shares until the requirements of the notice have been complied with. REDEMPTION AND PURCHASE OF SHARES 25. Subject to the provisions of the Law and the Memorandum, the Company may: 25.1 purchase its own Shares (including any redeemable Shares) in such manner and on such terms as the Directors may agree with the relevant Member unless following such purchase there would no longer be any issued Shares and may make payment for such purchase or for any redemption of Shares in any manner authorised by the Law, including out of capital; and 25.2 reduce its share capital and any capital redemption reserve fund in any manner whatsoever. 8 VARIATION OF SHARE RIGHTS Variation of class rights 26. If at any time the share capital is divided into different classes of Shares, all or any of the special rights attached to any class of Shares (unless otherwise provided by the terms of issue of the Shares of that class) may be varied or abrogated with the consent in writing of the holders of not less than two thirds of the issued Shares of that class or with the sanction of a resolution passed by the holders of not less than two thirds of the issued Shares of that class as may be present in person or by proxy at a separate general meeting of the holders of the Shares of that class. To any such separate general meeting, all of the provisions of these Articles relating to general meetings shall mutatis mutandis apply, but so that the necessary quorum shall be any one or more persons holding or representing by proxy not less than one third of the issued Shares of the class and that any holder of Shares of the relevant class present in person or by proxy may demand a poll. Treatment of classes 27. For the purpose of a separate class meeting, the Directors may treat two or more of all classes of Shares as forming one class if they consider that such class of Shares would be affected in the same way by the proposals under consideration. Effect of Share issue on class rights 28. The rights conferred upon the holders of any Shares shall not, unless otherwise expressly provided in the rights attaching to such Shares, be deemed to be altered by the creation or issue of further Shares ranking pari passu therewith. NON-RECOGNITION OF TRUSTS 29. Except as required by the Law or these Articles, or under an order of a court of competent jurisdiction, the Company shall not be bound by or compelled to recognise in any way, even when notice thereof is given to it, any equitable, contingent, future or partial interest in any Share, or any other rights in respect of any Share other than an absolute right to the entirety thereof in the registered holder. 9 LIEN Lien generally 30. The Company shall have a first and paramount lien on every Share (not being a fully paid Share) for all moneys (whether presently payable or not) called or payable at a date fixed by or in accordance with the terms of issue of such Share in respect of that Share, and the Company shall also have a first and paramount lien on every Share (other than a fully paid up Share) standing registered in the name of a Member, whether singly or jointly with any other person for all debts and liabilities of a Member or his estate to the Company, whether the same shall have been incurred before or after notice to the Company of any interest of any person other than such Member, and whether the time for the payment or discharge of the same shall have actually arrived or not, and notwithstanding that the same are joint debts or liabilities of such Member or his estate and any other person, whether a Member or not. The Directors may at any time, either generally or in any particular case, waive any lien that has arisen or declare any Share to be wholly or in part exempt from the provisions of this Article. The Company's lien, if any, on a Share shall extTermination to all dividTerminations payable thereon. Enforcement 31. The Company may sell, in such manner as the Directors think fit, any Share on which the Company has a lien, provided a sum in respect of which the lien exists is presently payable, and is not paid within fourteen days after a notice in writing has been given to the registered holder  for the time being of the Share, demanding payment of the sum presently payable and giving notice of the intention to sell in default of such payment. Completion of sale 32. For giving effect to any such sale, the Directors may authorise any person to Assignment the Share sold to the purchaser thereof. The purchaser shall be registered as the holder of the Share comprised in any such Assignment and he shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money, nor shall his title to the Share be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings relating to the sale. Application of proceeds 33. The net proceeds of such sale shall be applied in payment or discharge of the debt or liability in respect of which the lien exists and as is presently payable, and any balance shall (subject to a like lien for debts or liabilities not presently payable as existed upon the Shares prior to the sale) be paid to the person who was the registered holder of the Share immediately before such sale. CALLS ON SHARES Calls on Shares generally 34. The Directors may from time to time make calls upon the Members in respect of any moneys unpaid on their Shares (whether in respect of the par value of the Shares or premium or otherwise and not, by the terms of issue thereof, made payable at a future date fixed by or in accordance with such terms of issue); and each Member shall (subject to the Company serving upon him at least 14 days’ notice specifying the time or times and place of payment) pay to the Company at the time or times and place so specified the amount called on his Shares. A call may be revoked or postponed by the Directors wholly or in part as the Directors may determine. A call shall be deemed to have been made at the time when the resolution of the Directors authorising the call was passed. 10 Payment 35. Payment of a call may be made by instalments on the direction of the Directors. 36. If a sum called in respect of a Share is not paid before or on the day appointed for payment thereof, the person from whom the sum is due shall pay interest on the sum from the day payment is due to the time of the actual payment at such rate as the Directors may determine, but the Directors may waive payment of such interest wholly or in part. 37. Any sum payable in respect of a Share on issue or allotment or at any fixed date, whether in respect of the par value of the Share or premium or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a call and if it is not paid all the relevant provisions as to payment of interest, forfeiture or otherwise of these Articles shall apply as if such sum had become due and payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified. 38. The Directors may issue Shares with different terms as to the amount and times of payment of calls. Liability of joint holders 39. The joint holders of a Share shall be jointly and severally liable to pay calls in respect thereof. Interest 40. The Directors may, if they think fit, receive from any Member willing to advance the same, all or any part of the moneys uncalled and unpaid upon any Shares held by him; and may (until the amount would otherwise become payable) pay interest at such rate (not exceeding six per cent without the sanction of the Company in general meeting) as may be agreed upon between the Member paying the sum in advance and the Directors. FORFEITURE OF SHARES Notice 41. If a Member fails to pay any call or instalment of a call by the date it becomes due and payable, the Directors may, at any time thereafter while such call or instalment remains unpaid, give notice to the Member requiring payment of the unpaid portion of the call or instalment, together with any accrued interest and expenses incurred by the Company by reason of such non-payment. 11 42. The notice shall specify where and by what date (not being less than the Termination of 14 days’ from the date of the notice) payment is to be made and shall state that if it is not complied with the Shares in respect of which the call was made will be liable to be forfeited. The Directors may accept the surrTerminationer of any Share liable to be forfeited hereunder and, in such case, references to these Articles to forfeiture shall include surrTerminationer. Forfeiture for non-compliance 43. If such notice is not complied with, any Share in respect of which the notice was given may thereafter, before the payment of all calls or instalments and interest due in respect thereof has been made, be forfeited by a resolution of the Directors. Such forfeiture shall include all dividTerminations declared, other distributions or other monies payable in respect of the forfeited Shares and not paid before the forfeiture. Forfeited Shares 44. A forfeited Share may be sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed of upon such terms and in such manner as the Directors shall think fit, and at any time before a sale, re-allotment or disposition, the forfeiture may be cancelled on such terms as the Directors think fit. Continued liability for forfeited Member 45. A person whose Shares have been forfeited shall cease to be a Member in respect of the forfeited Shares, but shall remain liable to pay to the Company all moneys which at the date of forfeiture were presently payable by him in respect of the Shares together with interest at such rate as the Directors may determine from the date of forfeiture until payment, but his liability shall cease if and when the Company receives payment in full of all amounts due in respect of the Shares. The Company may enforce payment without being under any obligation to make any allowance for the value of the Shares forfeited. Evidence of forfeiture 46. An affidavit in writing by a Director or Secretary of the Company that a Share has been duly forfeited on a specified date, shall be conclusive evidence of the facts stated in it as against all persons claiming to be entitled to the Share. The Company may receive the consideration, if any, given for the Share on any sale, re-allotment or disposition thereof and may authorise some person to execute a Assignment of the Share in favour of the person to whom the Share is sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed of, and he shall thereupon be registered as the holder of the Share, and shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money (if any) nor shall his title to the Share be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings in reference to the forfeiture, sale, re-allotment or disposition of the Share. 12 47. The provisions of these Articles as to forfeiture shall apply in the case of non-payment of any sum which, by the terms of issue of a Share, becomes payable at a fixed time, whether on account of the par value of the Share, or by way of premium or otherwise, as if the same had been made payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified to the Member. INCREASE OF CAPITAL 48. The Company may from time to time by Ordinary Resolution increase its share capital by such sum, to be divided into new Shares of such par value, and with such rights, priorities and privileges attached thereto as the resolution shall prescribe. 49. Subject to any directions given by the Company in a general meeting, all new Shares shall be at the disposal of the Directors in accordance with these Articles. 50. The new Shares shall be subject to the same provisions of these Articles with reference to the payment of calls, lien, forfeiture, Assignment, transmission and otherwise, as the Shares in the original share capital. ALTERATION OF CAPITAL 51. The Company may from time to time by Ordinary Resolution: 51.1 consolidate and divide all or any of its share capital into Shares of larger par value than its existing Shares; 51.2 sub divide its existing Shares, or any of them, into Shares of smaller par value than is fixed by the Memorandum, subject nevertheless to the provisions of section 13 of the Law; 51.3 cancel any Shares which, at the date of the passing of the resolution, have not been taken or agreed to be taken by any person; and 51.4 convert all or any paid up Shares into stock, and reconvert all or any stock into paid up Shares of any denomination. 52. The Company may from time to time by Special Resolution: 52.1 divide its Shares into several classes and attach to such classes any preferential, deferred, or special rights or restrictions in accordance with these Articles; 52.2 change the currency denomination of its share capital; 13 52.3 reduce its share capital and any capital redemption reserve fund in any manner whatsoever; and 52.4 merge or consolidate with any one or more constituent companies (as defined in the Law). GENERAL MEETINGS Convening a meeting 53. The Directors may, whenever they think fit, convene an extraordinary general meeting. If at any time there are not sufficient Directors capable of acting to form a quorum, any Director, or any one or more Members holding in the aggregate not less than one third of the total issued share capital of the Company entitled to vote, may convene an extraordinary general meeting in the same manner as nearly as possible as that in which meetings may be convened by the Directors. Members’ requisition 54. The Directors shall, upon the requisition in writing of one or more Members holding in the aggregate not less than one tenth of such paid up capital of the Company as at the date of the requisition carries the right of voting at general meetings, convene an extraordinary general meeting. Any such requisition shall express the object of the meeting proposed to be called, and must be signed by the requisitionists and deposited at the Registered Office, and may consist of several documents in like form, each signed by one or more requisitionists. 55. If there are no Directors as at the date of the deposit of the Members’ requisition or if the Directors do not convene a general meeting within 21 days from the date of the deposit, the requisitionists or any or any of them or any other Member or Members holding in the aggregate not less than one tenth of such paid up capital of the Company as at the date of the requisition, may convene an extraordinary general meeting. A general meeting convened by requisitionists shall be convened in the same manner as nearly as possible as that in which general meetings are to be convened by the Directors. NOTICE OF GENERAL MEETINGS Length and form of notice 56. At least five clear days’ notice shall be given of any general meeting. Every notice shall specify the place, the day and the time of meeting and, in the case of special business, the general nature of the business to be conducted at the general meeting, and shall be given in the manner provided in these Articles or in such other manner (if any) as may be prescribed by the Company, to such persons as are entitled to receive such notices from the Company. A general meeting may be convened by such shorter notice, or without notice, by a majority in number of the Members having the right to attTermination and vote at the meeting, being a majority together holding not less than ninety-five percent in nominal value of the Shares giving that right. 14 Omission or non-receipt 57. The accidental omission to give notice of a meeting to, or the non-receipt of a notice of a meeting by, any Member entitled to receive notice shall not invalidate the proceedings at any meeting. PROCEEDINGS AT GENERAL MEETINGS 58. All business shall be deemed special that is transacted at an extraordinary general meeting. Quorum 59. No business shall be transacted at any general meeting unless a quorum of Members is present at the time that the meeting proceeds to business, but the absence of a quorum shall not preclude the appointment, choice or election of a chairman, which shall not be treated as part of the business of the Meeting. Save as herein otherwise provided, one or more Members holding in the aggregate not less than one third of the total issued share capital of the Company present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall be a quorum. Adjournment for lack of quorum 60. If within five minutes (or such longer time as the chairman of the meeting may determine to wait) after the time appointed for the meeting, a quorum is not present, the meeting, if convened upon the requisition of Members, shall be dissolved. In any other case, it shall stand adjourned to the same day in the next week, at the same time and place, and if at the adjourned meeting a quorum is not present within half an hour from the time appointed for the meeting, the Members present shall be a quorum. Meeting by telephone or other facilities 61. A meeting of the Members may be held by telephone, electronic or other communication facilities (including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, by telephone or video conferencing) by which all persons participating in the meeting can communicate with each other simultaneously and instantaneously, and participation in such a general meeting shall constitute presence in person at such meeting. 62. Any Director shall be entitled to attTermination and speak at any general meeting of the Company. 15 Appointment of chairman 63. The chairman (if any) of the Board of Directors shall preside as chairman at every general meeting of the Company. If there is no such chairman, or if at any meeting he is not present within five minutes after the time appointed for holding the meeting or is unwilling to act as chairman, the Directors present shall choose one of their number to act or, if only one Director is present, he shall preside as chairman if willing to act. If no Director is present, or if each of the Directors present declines to take the chair, the Members present and entitled to vote shall elect one of their number to be chairman. Adjournment of meeting 64. The chairman may, with the consent of a meeting at which a quorum is present (and shall if so directed by the meeting) adjourn the meeting from time to time and from place to place, but no business shall be transacted at any adjourned meeting other than the business left unfinished at the meeting from which the adjournment took place. When a meeting is adjourned for ten days or more, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given as in the case of an original meeting. Save as aforesaid, it shall not be necessary to give any notice of an adjournment or of the business to be transacted at an adjourned meeting. VOTING Ordinary Resolution Save where a Special Resolution or other greater majority is required by the Law or these Articles, any question proposed for consideration at any general meeting shall be decided by an Ordinary Resolution. Voting on a show of hands 65. At any general meeting, a resolution put to the vote of the meeting shall be decided on a show of hands, unless before or on the declaration of the result of the show of hands, or on the withdrawal of any other demand for a poll. Demand for poll 66. A poll is demanded by: 66.1 the chairman of the meeting; or 66.2 at least three Members present in person or by proxy; or 66.3 any Member or Members present in person or by proxy and holding collectively not less than one tenth of the total voting rights of all the Members having the right to vote at such meeting; or 16 66.4 a Member or Members present in person or by proxy holding Shares conferring the right to vote at such meeting, being Shares on which an aggregate sum has been paid up equal to not less than one tenth of the total sum paid up on all such Shares conferring such right. 67. Unless a poll is duly demanded and the demand is not withdrawn, a declaration by the chairman that a resolution has, on a show of hands, been carried or carried unanimously, or by a particular majority, or lost and an entry to that effect in the minutes of the proceedings of the Company shall be conclusive evidence of that fact, without proof of the number or proportion of the votes recorded in favour of, or against, that resolution. The demand for a poll may be withdrawn by the person or any persons making it at any time prior to the declaration of the result of the poll. 68. If a poll is duly demanded, it shall be taken in such manner as the chairman directs, and the result of the poll shall be deemed to be the resolution of the meeting at which the poll was demanded. 69. In the case of an equality of votes at a general meeting, whether on a show of hands or on a poll, the chairman of the meeting at which the show of hands takes place or at which the poll is demanded, shall not be entitled to a second or casting vote and the resolution shall fail. 70. A poll demanded on the election of a chairman or on a question of adjournment shall be taken forthwith. A poll demanded on any other question shall be taken in such manner and either forthwith or at such time later in the meeting as the chairman of the meeting shall direct. 71. The demand for a poll shall not prevent the continuance of a meeting for the transaction of any business other than the question on which the poll has been demanded and it may be withdrawn at any time before the close of the meeting or the taking of the poll, whichever is the earlier. Voting on a poll 72. On a poll votes may be cast either personally or by proxy. 73. A person entitled to more than one vote on a poll need not use all his votes or cast all the votes he uses in the same way. 74. On a show of hands, every Member present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall have one vote. On a poll, every Member present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall have one vote for each Share of which he is the registered holder. 17 75. In the case of joint holders of a Share, the vote of the senior who tTerminationers a vote, whether in person or by proxy, shall be accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint holders; and for this purpose seniority shall be determined by the order in which the names stand in the Register of Members in respect of the joint holding. 76. A Member of unsound mind, or, in respect of whom an order has been made by any court having jurisdiction in lunacy, may vote, whether on a show of hands or on a poll, by his receiver, committee, curator bonis or other person of similar nature appointed by such court, and any such receiver, committee, curator bonis or other person may vote by proxy and may otherwise act and be treated as such Member for the purpose of the general meetings. 77. No Member, unless the Directors otherwise determine, shall be entitled to vote at any general meeting, unless all calls or other sums presently payable by him in respect of Shares in the Company have been paid. 78. No objection shall be raised as to the qualification of any voter or as to whether any votes have been properly counted except at the general meeting or adjourned general meeting at which the vote objected to is given or tTerminationered and every vote not disallowed at the meeting shall be valid. Any objection made in due time and in accordance with these Articles shall be referred to the chairman whose decision shall be final and conclusive. Shareholder Restricted Matters 78A. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Memorandum or in these Articles or in the Law, for so long as HLNG is a Member, the Company shall not consent to or approve, and shall not permit any of Höegh LNG Colombia S.A.S. or Höegh LNG FSRU IV to consent to or approve, any of the following actions without the prior written consent of HLNG: 78A.1 any merger or consolidation involving any of the Company, Höegh LNG Colombia S.A.S. or Höegh LNG FSRU IV, or any of their respective subsidiaries; or 78A.2 any sale, exchange or Assignment of all or substantially all of the assets of any of the Company, Höegh LNG Colombia S.A.S. or Höegh LNG FSRU IV, or any of their respective subsidiaries; 78A.3 dissolution or liquidation of any of the Company, Höegh LNG Colombia S.A.S. or Höegh LNG FSRU IVor any of their respective subsidiaries; or 78A.4 creating or causing to exist any consensual restriction on the ability of any of the Company, Höegh LNG Colombia S.A.S. or Höegh LNG FSRU IV, or any of their respective subsidiaries, to make distributions, pay any indebtedness, make loans or advanes or Assignment assets to their respective owners, members or shareholders, or their respective subsidiaries; or 18 78A.5 settling or compromising any claim, dispute or Dispute Resolution directly against, or otherwise relating to indemnification by any of the Company, Höegh LNG Colombia S.A.S. or Höegh LNG FSRU IV, or any of their respective subsidiaries, of any of the directors or officers of HMLP, Höegh LNG Holdings Ltd. or HLNG, or their respective subsidiaries; or 78A.6 issuing any additional ownership interests in any of the Company, Höegh LNG Colombia S.A.S. or Höegh LNG FSRU IV[, or any of their respective subsidiaries]; or 78A.7 amTerminationing, supplementing or otherwise modifying, in whole or in part, the Memorandum or these Articles.

Any corporation which is a Member of the Company may by resolution of its directors or other governing body authorise such person as it thinks fit to act as its representative at any meeting of the Company or of any class of Members of the Company, and the person so authorised shall be entitled to exercise the same powers on behalf of the corporation which he represents as that corporation could exercise if it were an individual Member of the Company.

The instrument appointing a proxy or corporate representative, and the power of attorney (if any) under which it is signed, together with such other evidence as to its due execution as the Directors may from time to time require, shall be deposited at the Registered Office of the Company or at such other place as is specified for that purpose in the notice convening the meeting or in any notice of any adjournment or, in either case or the case of a written resolution, in any document sent therewith, not less than 24 hours (or such longer or shorter time as the Directors may determine) before the time for holding the meeting or adjourned meeting at which the person named in the instrument proposes to vote. 85. In default of any of the provisions in these Articles to deposit any instrument of proxy or authorisation at the Registered Office of the Company or at such other place as is specified for that purpose in the notice convening the meeting, the instrument of proxy or authorisation shall not be treated as valid provided that the chairman of the meeting may in his discretion accept an instrument of proxy or authorisation sent by email or fax upon receipt of email or fax confirmation that the signed original thereof has been sent. 20 Standing Proxy 86. The operation of a standing proxy or authorisation shall be suspTerminationed at any general meeting or adjournment thereof at which the Member is present in person or by specially appointed proxy.

The instrument appointing a proxy shall be deemed to confer authority to demand or join in demanding a poll, to speak at the meeting and to vote on any amTerminationment of a written resolution or amTerminationment of a resolution put to the meeting for which it is given as the proxy thinks fit. The instrument of proxy or authorisation shall, unless the contrary is stated therein, be valid as well for any adjournment of the meeting as for the meeting to which it relates.

No Director or officer shall be disqualified from his office or prevented by such office from holding any office or place of profit under the Company or under any company in which the Company shall be a Member or have any interest, or from contracting with the Company, either as vTerminationor, purchaser or otherwise, nor shall any such contract or any contract or transaction entered into by or on behalf of the Company in which any Director or officer shall be in any way interested be or be liable to be avoided nor shall any Director or officer so contracting, dealing or being so interested be liable to account to the Company for any profit realised by any such contract or transaction by reason of such Director holding office or of the fiduciary relation thereby established.

Directors may from time to time and at any time by power of attorney or otherwise appoint any company, firm or person or fluctuating body of persons, whether nominated directly or indirectly by the Directors, to be the attorney or attorneys of the Company for such purposes and with such powers, authorities and discretions (not exceeding those vested in or exercisable by the Directors under these Articles) and for such period and subject to such conditions as they may think fit, and any such power of attorney may contain such provisions for the protection and convenience of persons dealing with any such attorney and of such attorney as the Directors may think fit and may also authorise any such attorney to delegate all or any of the powers, authorities and discretions vested in him. 119.

Alternate Directors 120. Any Director may by writing appoint any other Director, or other person willing to act, to be his alternate and remove his alternate so appointed by him. Such appointment or removal shall be by notice to the Registered Office signed by the Director making or revoking the appointment or in any other manner approved by the Directors, and shall be effective on the date the notice is served and the alternate shall be notified of such appointment or revocation. Subject to the removal by the appointing Director, the alternate shall continue in office until the date on which his appointor ceases to be a Director. An alternate may also be a Director in his own right and may act as alternate to more than one Director. 121. An alternate shall be entitled to receive notice of all meetings of the Directors, attTermination, be counted in the quorum, vote and act in such appointor’s place at every such meeting at which the appointing Director is not personally present, and generally to perform all the functions of his appointor as a Director in his absence. 122.

An alternate Director shall be deemed for all purposes to be a Director and shall alone be responsible for his own acts and defaults and shall not be deemed to be the agent of the Director appointing him. The signature of an alternate to any resolution in writing of the Director or a committee there shall, unless the terms of the appointment provides to the contrary, be as effective as the signature of the Director or Directors to whom he is alternate. 28 Committees of Directors 124. The Directors may delegate any of their powers to committees consisting of such member or members of their body as they think fit; any committee so formed shall, in the exercise of the powers so delegated, conform to any regulations that may be imposed on it by the Directors. 125. A committee may elect a chairman of its meetings; if no such chairman is elected, or if at any meeting the chairman is not present within five minutes after the time appointed for holding the same, the members present may choose one of their number to be chairman of the meeting. 126. A committee may meet and adjourn as it thinks proper. Questions arising at any meeting shall be determined by a majority of votes of the members present and in case of an equality of votes the chairman shall not have a second or casting vote and the motion shall be deemed to have been lost. Officers 127. The Directors may appoint a Secretary and such other officers as they may from time to time consider necessary upon such terms as to duration of office, remuneration and otherwise as they may think fit. Such Secretary or other officers need not be Directors and in the case of the other officers may be ascribed such titles as the Directors may decide and the Directors may revoke or terminate any such election or appointment. Any such revocation or termination shall be without prejudice to any claim for any damages that such officer may have against the Company or the Company may have against such officer for any breach of any contract of service between him and the Company which may be involved in such revocation or termination. Save as provided in the Law or these Articles, the powers and duties of the officers of the Company shall be such (if any) as are determined from time to time by the Directors. DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION Remuneration 128. The remuneration to be paid to the Directors, if any, shall be determined by the Company in general meeting or, in the absence of such a determination, by the Directors. Expenses 129. Each Director shall also be entitled to be paid his reasonable travelling, hotel and other expenses properly incurred by him in connection with his attTerminationance at meetings of the Directors, committees of the Directors or general meetings of the Company, or otherwise in connection with the business of the Company, or to receive a fixed allowance in respect thereof as may be determined by the Directors, or a combination partly of one such method and partly the other. 29 Additional remuneration 130. The Directors may by resolution approve additional remuneration to any Director for services which in the opinion of the Directors go beyond the ordinary duties of a Director, and such extra remuneration shall be in addition to any remuneration provided for, by or pursuant to any other Article. SEALS AND DEEDS Use of Seal 131. The Directors may determine that the Company shall have a Seal, and if they so determine, shall provide for the safe custody of the Seal. The Seal shall only be used by the authority of the Directors and in the presence of a Director or the Secretary or such other person as the Directors may by resolution appoint for this purpose, and every instrument to which the Seal affixed shall be signed by the relevant person. Notwithstanding the above, annual returns and notices filed under the Law may be executed either as a deed or under Seal and in either case without the need for the authority of a resolution of the Directors. 30 Duplicate Seal 132. The Company may maintain in any place or places outside the Cayman Islands a facsimile of any Seal and such facsimile seal shall be affixed in the same way as if it were the Seal. Execution of deeds 133. In accordance with the Law, the Company may execute any deed or other instrument (which would otherwise be required to be executed under Seal) by the signature of such deed or instrument as a deed by a Director or by the Secretary of the Company or by such other person as the Directors may appoint or by any other person or attorney on behalf of the Company appointed by a deed or other instrument executed as a deed by a Director or the Secretary or such other person as aforesaid. DIVIDTerminationS Payment of DividTerminations 134. The Directors may from time to time declare dividTerminations to be paid to the Members according to their rights and interests, including such interim dividTerminations as appear to the Directors to be justified by the position of the Company. The Directors may also pay any fixed cash dividTermination which is payable on any Shares of the Company half yearly or on such other dates, whenever the position of the Company, in the opinion of the Directors, justifies such payment. 135. No dividTermination shall be paid otherwise than out of profits or out of monies otherwise available for dividTermination in accordance with the Law. Calculation of DividTerminations 136. Subject to the rights of Members, if any, entitled to Shares with special rights as to dividTerminations, all dividTerminations shall be declared and paid according to the amount paid up on the Shares in respect of which the dividTermination is paid and any dividTermination on any class of Shares not fully paid shall be declared and paid according to the amounts paid on the Shares of that class, but if and so long as nothing is paid up on any of the Shares in the Company, dividTerminations may be declared and paid according to the number of Shares. No amount paid on a Share in advance of calls shall, while carrying interest, be treated for the purposes of this Article as paid on the Share. DividTerminations may be apportioned and paid pro rata according to the amounts paid-up on the Shares during any portion or portions of the period in respect of which the dividTermination is paid. 31 Deductions 137. The Directors may deduct from any dividTermination, distribution or other monies payable to a Member by the Company on or in respect of any Shares all sums of money (if any) presently payable by him to the Company on account of calls or otherwise in respect of Shares of the Company. Joint Holders 138. If several persons are registered as joint holders of any Share, any of them may give effectual receipts for any dividTermination or other money payable on or in respect of the Share. Payment method 139. Any dividTermination may be paid by cheque or warrant sent through the post to the address of the Member or person entitled thereto in the Register of Members or, in the case of joint holders addressed to the holder whose name stands first in the Register of Members in respect of the Shares at his registered address as appearing on the Register of Members or to such person and such address as the Member or person entitled or such joint holders as the case may be may direct in writing. Every such cheque or warrant shall, unless the holder or joint holders may in writing direct, be made payable to the order of the person to whom it is sent or to the order of the holder or, in the case of joint holders, to the order of the holder whose name stands first in the Register of Members in respect of such Shares, and shall be sent at his or their risk and payment of the cheque or warrant by the bank on which it is drawn shall constitute a good discharge to the Company. Any one of two or more joint holders may give effectual receipts for any dividTerminations, distributions or other monies payable or property distributable in respect of the Shares held by such joint holders. Satisfaction by distribution of specific assets 140. The Directors may declare that any dividTermination or distribution is paid wholly or partly by the distribution of specific assets and, in particular, of paid up shares, debentures or debenture stock of any other company or in any one or more of such ways, and where any difficulty arises in regard to such dividTermination or distribution, the Directors may settle the same as they think expedient, and in particular may issue fractional Shares or ignore fractions altogether and may fix the value for dividTermination or distribution of such specific assets or any part thereof and may determine that cash payments shall be made to any Members upon the basis of the value so fixed in order to secure equality of distribution, and may vest any such specific assets in trustees as may seem expedient to the Directors. 32 No interest 141. No dividTermination or other distribution or other monies payable by the Company on or in respect of any Share shall bear interest against the Company. Unclaimed dividTerminations 142. All unclaimed dividTerminations or distributions may be invested or otherwise made use of by the Directors for the benefit of the Company until claimed. Any dividTermination or distribution unclaimed by a Member six years after the dividTermination or distribution payment date shall be forfeited and revert to the Company. RESERVES 143. The Directors may, before declaring any dividTermination or distribution, set aside such sums as they think proper as a reserve or reserves which shall, at the discretion of the Directors, be applicable for meeting contingencies, or for equalising dividTerminations, or for any other purpose of the Company, and pTerminationing such application may, in their discretion, be employed in the business of the Company or be invested in such manner as the Directors may from time to time think fit. The Directors may also without placing the same to reserve carry forward any sums which they think it prudent not to distribute. CAPITALISATION OF PROFITS Capitalisation 144. The Directors may capitalise any sum standing to the credit of any of the Company’s reserve accounts which are available for distribution (including its Share Premium Account and capital redemption reserve fund, subject to the Law) or any sum standing to the credit of the profit and loss account or otherwise available for distribution and to appropriate such sums to Members in the proportions in which such sum would have been divisible amongst them had the same been a distribution of profits by way of dividTermination and to apply such sum on their behalf in paying up in full unissued Shares for allotment and distribution credited as fully paid-up to and amongst them in the proportion aforesaid. Authorisation 145. Where any difficulty arises in regard to any distribution under the last preceding Article, the Directors may settle the same as they think expedient and, in particular, may authorise any person to sell and Assignment any fractions or may resolve that the distribution should be as nearly as may be practicable in the correct proportion but not exactly so or may ignore fractions altogether, and may determine that cash payments should be made to any Members in order to adjust the rights of all parties, as may seem expedient to the Directors. The Directors may appoint any person to sign on behalf of the persons entitled to participate in the distribution any contract necessary or desirable for giving effect thereto and such appointment shall be effective and binding upon the Members. 33 SHARE PREMIUM ACCOUNT 146. The Directors shall in accordance with the Law establish a Share Premium Account and shall carry to the credit of such account from time to time a sum equal to the amount or value of the premium paid on the issue of any Share. 147. There shall be debited to any Share Premium Account on the redemption or purchase of a Share the difference between the nominal value of such Share and the redemption or purchase price provided always that at the discretion of the Directors such sum may be paid out of the profits of the Company or, if permitted by the Law, out of capital. ACCOUNTING RECORDS Books of account 148. The Directors shall cause to be kept accounting records sufficient to give a true and fair view of the state of the Company's affairs and to show and explain its transactions and otherwise in accordance with the Law. Inspection by Members 149. The accounting records shall be kept at the Registered Office or at such other place or places as the Directors think fit, and shall at all times be open to inspection by the Directors. No Member (who is not also a Director) shall have any right to inspect any accounting record or book or document of the Company except as conferred by law or authorised by the Directors or by the Members by Ordinary Resolution. Records and audit 150. From time to time the Company in general meeting may determine (or revoke, alter or amTermination any such determination) or, failing such determination, the Directors may determine (or revoke, alter or amTermination any such determination): 150.1 that the accounts of the Company be audited and the appointment of the Auditors; 150.2 that there be prepared and sent to each Member and other person entitled thereto a profit and loss account, a balance sheet, group accounts and/or reports for such period and on such terms as they may determine; and 150.3 that there be laid before the Company in general meeting a copy of every balance sheet together with a copy of the Auditor's report. 34 SERVICE OF NOTICES AND DOCUMENTS Form and delivery of notices 151. Notices or other documents or communications may be given to any Member by the Company either personally or by sTerminationing it by courier, post, fax or email to him to his registered address, or (if he has no registered address) to the address, if any, supplied by him to the Company for the giving of notices to him. Any notice shall be deemed to be effected: 151.1 if delivered personally or sent by courier, by properly addressing and prepaying a letter containing the notice; and to have been effected, in the case of a notice of a meeting, when delivered; 151.2 if sent by post, by properly addressing, prepaying, and posting a letter containing the notice (by airmail if available) and to have been effected, in the case of a notice of a meeting, at the Termination of three days after it was posted; and 151.3 if sent by fax or email by properly addressing and sTerminationing such notice through the appropriate transmitting medium and to have been effected on the day the same is sent. 152. A notice may be given by the Company to the joint holders of a Share by giving the notice to the joint holder named first in the Register of Members in respect of the Share. 153. A notice may be given by the Company to the person entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a Member by sTerminationing it through the post in a prepaid letter addressed to them by name, or by the title of representatives of the deceased, or trustee of the bankrupt, or by any like description, at the address, if any, supplied for the purpose by the persons claiming to be so entitled, or (until such an address has been so supplied) by giving the notice in any manner in which the same might have been given if the death or bankruptcy had not occurred. 154. Notice of every general meeting shall be given in any manner hereinbefore authorised to: 154.1 every Member entitled to vote except those Members entitled to vote who (having no registered address) have not supplied to the Company an address for the giving of notices to them; and 154.2 every person entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a Member, who, but for his death or bankruptcy would be entitled to receive notice of the meeting. 155. No other persons shall be entitled to receive notices of general meeting. 35 WINDING UP Method of winding up 156. Subject to the rights attaching to any Shares, if the Company shall be wound up, the liquidator may, with the sanction of a Special Resolution and any other sanction required by the Law or these Articles, divide amongst the Members in kind the whole or any part of the assets of the Company (whether they shall consist of property of the same kind or not) and may for such purpose set such value as he deems fair upon any property to be divided as aforesaid and may determine how such division shall be carried out as between the Members or different classes of Members. The liquidator may, with the like sanction, vest the whole or any part of such assets in trustees upon such trusts for the benefit of the contributories as the liquidator, with the like sanction, shall think fit, but so that no Member shall be compelled to accept any asset upon which there is any liability. Distribution of assets 157. If the Company shall be wound up and the assets available for distribution amongst the Members as such shall be insufficient to repay the whole of the paid up capital, such assets shall be distributed so that, as nearly as may be, the losses shall be borne by the Members in proportion to the capital paid up, or which ought to have been paid up, at the commencement of the winding up, on the Shares held by them respectively. And if in a winding up the assets available for distribution amongst the Members shall be more than sufficient to repay the whole of the capital paid up at the commencement of the winding up, the excess shall be distributed amongst the Members in proportion to the capital paid up at the commencement of the winding up on the Shares held by them respectively. This Article is to be without prejudice to the rights of the holders of Shares issued upon special terms and conditions. Indemnification Indemnification and limitation of liability 158. Every Indemnified Person shall, in the absence of wilful neglect or default, be indemnified and held harmless out of the assets of the Company against all liabilities, loss, damage, cost or expense (including but not limited to liabilities under contract, tort and statute or any applicable foreign law or regulation and all reasonable legal and other costs and expenses on a full Indemnification basis properly payable) incurred or suffered by him by or by reason of any act done, conceived in or omitted in the conduct of the Company’s business or in the discharge of his duties and the Indemnification contained in this Article shall extTermination to any Indemnified Person acting in any office or trust in the reasonable belief that he has been appointed or elected to such office or trust notwithstanding any defect in such appointment or election. 36 159. No Indemnified Person shall be liable to the Company for acts, defaults or omissions of any other Indemnified Person. Indemnification and reimbursement 160. Every Indemnified Person shall be indemnified out of the funds of the Company against all liabilities incurred by him by or by reason of any act done, conceived in or omitted in the conduct of the Company’s business or in the discharge of his duties in defTerminationing any proceedings, whether civil or criminal, in which judgment is given in his favour, or in which he is acquitted, or in connection with any application in which relief from liability is granted to him by the court. 161. To the extent that any Indemnified Person is entitled to claim an Indemnification pursuant to these Articles in respect of amounts paid or discharged by him, the relative Indemnification shall take effect as an obligation of the Company to reimburse the person making such payment or effecting such discharge. Wilful neglect or default 162. Each Member and the Company agree to waive any claim or right of action he or it may at any time have, whether individually or by or in the right of the Company, against any Indemnified Person on account of any act or omission of such Indemnified Person in the performance of his duties for the Company; provided however, that such waiver shall not apply to any claims or rights of action arising out of the wilful neglect or default of such Indemnified Person or to recover any gain, personal profit or advantage to which such Indemnified Person is not legally entitled. Advance of legal fees 163. Expenses incurred in defTerminationing any civil or criminal action or proceeding for which indemnification is required pursuant to these Articles shall be paid by the Company in advance of the final disposition of such action or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnified Person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that the Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified pursuant to these Articles. Each Member of the Company shall be deemed to have acknowledged and agreed that the advances of funds may be made by the Company as aforesaid, and when made by the Company under this Article are made to meet expTerminationitures incurred for the purpose of enabling such Indemnified Person to properly perform his or her duties to the Company. 37 CONTINUATION 164. The Company shall have the power, subject to the provisions of the Law and with the approval of a Special Resolution, to continue as a body incorporated under the laws of any jurisdiction outside of the Cayman Islands and to be de-registered in the Cayman Islands. AMTerminationMENT OF MEMORANDUM AND ARTICLES Subject to the provisions of the Law, the Company may from time to time by Special Resolution alter or amTermination the Memorandum or these Articles in whole or in part provided that no such amTerminationment shall affect the special rights attaching to any class of Shares without the consent or sanction provided for in these Articles.

The Directors may fix in advance a date as the record date to determine the Members entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of the Members and, for the purpose of determining the Members entitled to receive payment of any dividTermination, the Directors may, at or within 90 days prior to the date of the declaration of such dividTermination, fix a subsequent date as the record date for such determination. No fixed record date 11. If no such record date is fixed, the record date shall be the date on which notice of the meeting is sent or the date on which the resolution of the Directors declaring such dividTermination is adopted, as the case may be.

The instrument of Assignment of any Share shall be executed by or on behalf of the Assignmentor (and, if the Directors so determine, the Assignmentee). The Assignmentor shall be deemed to remain the holder of the Share until the name of the Assignmentee is entered in the Register of Members in respect of such Share. All instruments of Assignment, once registered, may be retained by the Company. 17. Subject to any applicable restrictions contained in these Articles, Shares shall be Assignmentred in any usual or common form approved by the Directors. Refusal to register Assignments 18. The Directors may, in their absolute discretion and without assigning any reason therefore, decline to register any Assignment of any Share. The Directors may require reasonable evidence to show the right of the Assignmentor to make the Assignment. 19. If the Directors decline to register a Assignment of Shares they shall sTermination notice of the refusal to the Assignmentee within one month after the date on which the Assignment was lodged with the Company. 20. The Directors may also suspTermination the registration of the Assignments at such times and for such periods as the Directors may from time to time determine. TRANSMISSION OF SHARES Transmission of Shares 21. If a Member dies, the survivor or survivors (where he was a joint holder), and the legal personal representative (where he was sole holder), shall be the only person recognised by the Company as having any title to the Share. The estate of a deceased Member is not thereby released from any liability in respect of any Share held by him, whether solely or jointly. For the purpose of this Article, legal personal representative means the person to whom probate or letters of administration has or have been granted in the Cayman Islands or, if there is no such person, such other person as the Directors may in their absolute discretion determine to be the person recognised by the Company for the purpose of this Article. Election by persons entitled on transmission 22. Any person becoming entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a Member or otherwise by operation of Governing Law may elect, upon such evidence being produced as may be required by the Directors as to his entitlement, either be registered himself as a Member in respect of the Share or, instead of being registered himself, to make such Assignment of the Share as the deceased or bankrupt Member could have made. 7 Manner of election 23. If the person so becoming entitled elects to be registered himself, he shall deliver or sTermination to the Company a notice in writing signed by him stating that he so elects. If he shall elect to Assignment the Shares, he shall signify his election by signing an instrument of Assignment of such Shares in favour of his Assignmentee. All the limitations, restrictions and provisions of these Articles relating to the right to Assignment and the registration of Assignments of Shares shall be applicable to any such notice or instrument of Assignment as aforesaid as if the death of the Member or other event giving rise to the transmission had not occurred and the notice or instrument of Assignment was an instrument of Assignment signed by such Member. Rights of persons entitled on transmission 24. A person becoming entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of the Member (or otherwise by operation of Governing Law), upon such evidence being produced as may be required by the Directors as to his entitlement, shall be entitled to the same dividTerminations and other monies payable in respect of the Share as he would be entitled if he were the holder of such Share. However, he shall not be entitled, until he becomes registered as the holder of such Share, to receive notices of or to attTermination or vote at general meetings of the Company or (except as aforesaid) to exercise any other rights or privileges of a Member. The Directors may at any time give notice requiring such person to elect either to be registered himself or to Assignment the Share and, if the notice is not complied with within sixty days, the Directors may thereafter withhold payment of all dividTerminations and other monies payable in respect of the Shares until the requirements of the notice have been complied with. REDEMPTION AND PURCHASE OF SHARES 25. Subject to the provisions of the Law and the Memorandum, the Company may: 25.1 purchase its own Shares (including any redeemable Shares) in such manner and on such terms as the Directors may agree with the relevant Member unless following such purchase there would no longer be any issued Shares and may make payment for such purchase or for any redemption of Shares in any manner authorised by the Law, including out of capital; and 25.2 reduce its share capital and any capital redemption reserve fund in any manner whatsoever. 8 VARIATION OF SHARE RIGHTS Variation of class rights 26. If at any time the share capital is divided into different classes of Shares, all or any of the special rights attached to any class of Shares (unless otherwise provided by the terms of issue of the Shares of that class) may be varied or abrogated with the consent in writing of the holders of not less than two thirds of the issued Shares of that class or with the sanction of a resolution passed by the holders of not less than two thirds of the issued Shares of that class as may be present in person or by proxy at a separate general meeting of the holders of the Shares of that class. To any such separate general meeting, all of the provisions of these Articles relating to general meetings shall mutatis mutandis apply, but so that the necessary quorum shall be any one or more persons holding or representing by proxy not less than one third of the issued Shares of the class and that any holder of Shares of the relevant class present in person or by proxy may demand a poll. Treatment of classes 27. For the purpose of a separate class meeting, the Directors may treat two or more of all classes of Shares as forming one class if they consider that such class of Shares would be affected in the same way by the proposals under consideration. Effect of Share issue on class rights 28. The rights conferred upon the holders of any Shares shall not, unless otherwise expressly provided in the rights attaching to such Shares, be deemed to be altered by the creation or issue of further Shares ranking pari passu therewith. NON-RECOGNITION OF TRUSTS 29. Except as required by the Law or these Articles, or under an order of a court of competent jurisdiction, the Company shall not be bound by or compelled to recognise in any way, even when notice thereof is given to it, any equitable, contingent, future or partial interest in any Share, or any other rights in respect of any Share other than an absolute right to the entirety thereof in the registered holder. 9 LIEN Lien generally 30. The Company shall have a first and paramount lien on every Share (not being a fully paid Share) for all moneys (whether presently payable or not) called or payable at a date fixed by or in accordance with the terms of issue of such Share in respect of that Share, and the Company shall also have a first and paramount lien on every Share (other than a fully paid up Share) standing registered in the name of a Member, whether singly or jointly with any other person for all debts and liabilities of a Member or his estate to the Company, whether the same shall have been incurred before or after notice to the Company of any interest of any person other than such Member, and whether the time for the payment or discharge of the same shall have actually arrived or not, and notwithstanding that the same are joint debts or liabilities of such Member or his estate and any other person, whether a Member or not. The Directors may at any time, either generally or in any particular case, waive any lien that has arisen or declare any Share to be wholly or in part exempt from the provisions of this Article. The Company's lien, if any, on a Share shall extTermination to all dividTerminations payable thereon. Enforcement 31. The Company may sell, in such manner as the Directors think fit, any Share on which the Company has a lien, provided a sum in respect of which the lien exists is presently payable, and is not paid within fourteen days after a notice in writing has been given to the registered holder  for the time being of the Share, demanding payment of the sum presently payable and giving notice of the intention to sell in default of such payment. Completion of sale 32. For giving effect to any such sale, the Directors may authorise any person to Assignment the Share sold to the purchaser thereof. The purchaser shall be registered as the holder of the Share comprised in any such Assignment and he shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money, nor shall his title to the Share be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings relating to the sale. Application of proceeds 33. The net proceeds of such sale shall be applied in payment or discharge of the debt or liability in respect of which the lien exists and as is presently payable, and any balance shall (subject to a like lien for debts or liabilities not presently payable as existed upon the Shares prior to the sale) be paid to the person who was the registered holder of the Share immediately before such sale. CALLS ON SHARES Calls on Shares generally 34. The Directors may from time to time make calls upon the Members in respect of any moneys unpaid on their Shares (whether in respect of the par value of the Shares or premium or otherwise and not, by the terms of issue thereof, made payable at a future date fixed by or in accordance with such terms of issue); and each Member shall (subject to the Company serving upon him at least 14 days’ notice specifying the time or times and place of payment) pay to the Company at the time or times and place so specified the amount called on his Shares. A call may be revoked or postponed by the Directors wholly or in part as the Directors may determine. A call shall be deemed to have been made at the time when the resolution of the Directors authorising the call was passed. 10 Payment 35. Payment of a call may be made by instalments on the direction of the Directors. 36. If a sum called in respect of a Share is not paid before or on the day appointed for payment thereof, the person from whom the sum is due shall pay interest on the sum from the day payment is due to the time of the actual payment at such rate as the Directors may determine, but the Directors may waive payment of such interest wholly or in part. 37. Any sum payable in respect of a Share on issue or allotment or at any fixed date, whether in respect of the par value of the Share or premium or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a call and if it is not paid all the relevant provisions as to payment of interest, forfeiture or otherwise of these Articles shall apply as if such sum had become due and payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified. 38. The Directors may issue Shares with different terms as to the amount and times of payment of calls. Liability of joint holders 39. The joint holders of a Share shall be jointly and severally liable to pay calls in respect thereof. Interest 40. The Directors may, if they think fit, receive from any Member willing to advance the same, all or any part of the moneys uncalled and unpaid upon any Shares held by him; and may (until the amount would otherwise become payable) pay interest at such rate (not exceeding six per cent without the sanction of the Company in general meeting) as may be agreed upon between the Member paying the sum in advance and the Directors. FORFEITURE OF SHARES Notice 41. If a Member fails to pay any call or instalment of a call by the date it becomes due and payable, the Directors may, at any time thereafter while such call or instalment remains unpaid, give notice to the Member requiring payment of the unpaid portion of the call or instalment, together with any accrued interest and expenses incurred by the Company by reason of such non-payment. 11 42. The notice shall specify where and by what date (not being less than the Termination of 14 days’ from the date of the notice) payment is to be made and shall state that if it is not complied with the Shares in respect of which the call was made will be liable to be forfeited. The Directors may accept the surrTerminationer of any Share liable to be forfeited hereunder and, in such case, references to these Articles to forfeiture shall include surrTerminationer. Forfeiture for non-compliance 43. If such notice is not complied with, any Share in respect of which the notice was given may thereafter, before the payment of all calls or instalments and interest due in respect thereof has been made, be forfeited by a resolution of the Directors. Such forfeiture shall include all dividTerminations declared, other distributions or other monies payable in respect of the forfeited Shares and not paid before the forfeiture. Forfeited Shares 44. A forfeited Share may be sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed of upon such terms and in such manner as the Directors shall think fit, and at any time before a sale, re-allotment or disposition, the forfeiture may be cancelled on such terms as the Directors think fit. Continued liability for forfeited Member 45. A person whose Shares have been forfeited shall cease to be a Member in respect of the forfeited Shares, but shall remain liable to pay to the Company all moneys which at the date of forfeiture were presently payable by him in respect of the Shares together with interest at such rate as the Directors may determine from the date of forfeiture until payment, but his liability shall cease if and when the Company receives payment in full of all amounts due in respect of the Shares. The Company may enforce payment without being under any obligation to make any allowance for the value of the Shares forfeited. Evidence of forfeiture 46. An affidavit in writing by a Director or Secretary of the Company that a Share has been duly forfeited on a specified date, shall be conclusive evidence of the facts stated in it as against all persons claiming to be entitled to the Share. The Company may receive the consideration, if any, given for the Share on any sale, re-allotment or disposition thereof and may authorise some person to execute a Assignment of the Share in favour of the person to whom the Share is sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed of, and he shall thereupon be registered as the holder of the Share, and shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money (if any) nor shall his title to the Share be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings in reference to the forfeiture, sale, re-allotment or disposition of the Share. 12 47. The provisions of these Articles as to forfeiture shall apply in the case of non-payment of any sum which, by the terms of issue of a Share, becomes payable at a fixed time, whether on account of the par value of the Share, or by way of premium or otherwise, as if the same had been made payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified to the Member. INCREASE OF CAPITAL 48. The Company may from time to time by Ordinary Resolution increase its share capital by such sum, to be divided into new Shares of such par value, and with such rights, priorities and privileges attached thereto as the resolution shall prescribe. 49. Subject to any directions given by the Company in a general meeting, all new Shares shall be at the disposal of the Directors in accordance with these Articles. 50. The new Shares shall be subject to the same provisions of these Articles with reference to the payment of calls, lien, forfeiture, Assignment, transmission and otherwise, as the Shares in the original share capital. ALTERATION OF CAPITAL 51. The Company may from time to time by Ordinary Resolution: 51.1 consolidate and divide all or any of its share capital into Shares of larger par value than its existing Shares; 51.2 sub divide its existing Shares, or any of them, into Shares of smaller par value than is fixed by the Memorandum, subject nevertheless to the provisions of section 13 of the Law; 51.3 cancel any Shares which, at the date of the passing of the resolution, have not been taken or agreed to be taken by any person; and 51.4 convert all or any paid up Shares into stock, and reconvert all or any stock into paid up Shares of any denomination. 52. The Company may from time to time by Special Resolution: 52.1 divide its Shares into several classes and attach to such classes any preferential, deferred, or special rights or restrictions in accordance with these Articles; 52.2 change the currency denomination of its share capital; 13 52.3 reduce its share capital and any capital redemption reserve fund in any manner whatsoever; and 52.4 merge or consolidate with any one or more constituent companies (as defined in the Law). GENERAL MEETINGS Convening a meeting 53. The Directors may, whenever they think fit, convene an extraordinary general meeting. If at any time there are not sufficient Directors capable of acting to form a quorum, any Director, or any one or more Members holding in the aggregate not less than one third of the total issued share capital of the Company entitled to vote, may convene an extraordinary general meeting in the same manner as nearly as possible as that in which meetings may be convened by the Directors. Members’ requisition 54. The Directors shall, upon the requisition in writing of one or more Members holding in the aggregate not less than one tenth of such paid up capital of the Company as at the date of the requisition carries the right of voting at general meetings, convene an extraordinary general meeting. Any such requisition shall express the object of the meeting proposed to be called, and must be signed by the requisitionists and deposited at the Registered Office, and may consist of several documents in like form, each signed by one or more requisitionists. 55. If there are no Directors as at the date of the deposit of the Members’ requisition or if the Directors do not convene a general meeting within 21 days from the date of the deposit, the requisitionists or any or any of them or any other Member or Members holding in the aggregate not less than one tenth of such paid up capital of the Company as at the date of the requisition, may convene an extraordinary general meeting. A general meeting convened by requisitionists shall be convened in the same manner as nearly as possible as that in which general meetings are to be convened by the Directors. NOTICE OF GENERAL MEETINGS Length and form of notice 56. At least five clear days’ notice shall be given of any general meeting. Every notice shall specify the place, the day and the time of meeting and, in the case of special business, the general nature of the business to be conducted at the general meeting, and shall be given in the manner provided in these Articles or in such other manner (if any) as may be prescribed by the Company, to such persons as are entitled to receive such notices from the Company. A general meeting may be convened by such shorter notice, or without notice, by a majority in number of the Members having the right to attTermination and vote at the meeting, being a majority together holding not less than ninety-five percent in nominal value of the Shares giving that right. 14 Omission or non-receipt 57. The accidental omission to give notice of a meeting to, or the non-receipt of a notice of a meeting by, any Member entitled to receive notice shall not invalidate the proceedings at any meeting. PROCEEDINGS AT GENERAL MEETINGS 58. All business shall be deemed special that is transacted at an extraordinary general meeting. Quorum 59. No business shall be transacted at any general meeting unless a quorum of Members is present at the time that the meeting proceeds to business, but the absence of a quorum shall not preclude the appointment, choice or election of a chairman, which shall not be treated as part of the business of the Meeting. Save as herein otherwise provided, one or more Members holding in the aggregate not less than one third of the total issued share capital of the Company present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall be a quorum. Adjournment for lack of quorum 60. If within five minutes (or such longer time as the chairman of the meeting may determine to wait) after the time appointed for the meeting, a quorum is not present, the meeting, if convened upon the requisition of Members, shall be dissolved. In any other case, it shall stand adjourned to the same day in the next week, at the same time and place, and if at the adjourned meeting a quorum is not present within half an hour from the time appointed for the meeting, the Members present shall be a quorum. Meeting by telephone or other facilities 61. A meeting of the Members may be held by telephone, electronic or other communication facilities (including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, by telephone or video conferencing) by which all persons participating in the meeting can communicate with each other simultaneously and instantaneously, and participation in such a general meeting shall constitute presence in person at such meeting. 62. Any Director shall be entitled to attTermination and speak at any general meeting of the Company. 15 Appointment of chairman 63. The chairman (if any) of the Board of Directors shall preside as chairman at every general meeting of the Company. If there is no such chairman, or if at any meeting he is not present within five minutes after the time appointed for holding the meeting or is unwilling to act as chairman, the Directors present shall choose one of their number to act or, if only one Director is present, he shall preside as chairman if willing to act. If no Director is present, or if each of the Directors present declines to take the chair, the Members present and entitled to vote shall elect one of their number to be chairman. Adjournment of meeting 64. The chairman may, with the consent of a meeting at which a quorum is present (and shall if so directed by the meeting) adjourn the meeting from time to time and from place to place, but no business shall be transacted at any adjourned meeting other than the business left unfinished at the meeting from which the adjournment took place. When a meeting is adjourned for ten days or more, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given as in the case of an original meeting. Save as aforesaid, it shall not be necessary to give any notice of an adjournment or of the business to be transacted at an adjourned meeting. VOTING Ordinary Resolution Save where a Special Resolution or other greater majority is required by the Law or these Articles, any question proposed for consideration at any general meeting shall be decided by an Ordinary Resolution. Voting on a show of hands 65. At any general meeting, a resolution put to the vote of the meeting shall be decided on a show of hands, unless before or on the declaration of the result of the show of hands, or on the withdrawal of any other demand for a poll. Demand for poll 66. A poll is demanded by: 66.1 the chairman of the meeting; or 66.2 at least three Members present in person or by proxy; or 66.3 any Member or Members present in person or by proxy and holding collectively not less than one tenth of the total voting rights of all the Members having the right to vote at such meeting; or 16 66.4 a Member or Members present in person or by proxy holding Shares conferring the right to vote at such meeting, being Shares on which an aggregate sum has been paid up equal to not less than one tenth of the total sum paid up on all such Shares conferring such right. 67. Unless a poll is duly demanded and the demand is not withdrawn, a declaration by the chairman that a resolution has, on a show of hands, been carried or carried unanimously, or by a particular majority, or lost and an entry to that effect in the minutes of the proceedings of the Company shall be conclusive evidence of that fact, without proof of the number or proportion of the votes recorded in favour of, or against, that resolution. The demand for a poll may be withdrawn by the person or any persons making it at any time prior to the declaration of the result of the poll. 68. If a poll is duly demanded, it shall be taken in such manner as the chairman directs, and the result of the poll shall be deemed to be the resolution of the meeting at which the poll was demanded. 69. In the case of an equality of votes at a general meeting, whether on a show of hands or on a poll, the chairman of the meeting at which the show of hands takes place or at which the poll is demanded, shall not be entitled to a second or casting vote and the resolution shall fail. 70. A poll demanded on the election of a chairman or on a question of adjournment shall be taken forthwith. A poll demanded on any other question shall be taken in such manner and either forthwith or at such time later in the meeting as the chairman of the meeting shall direct. 71. The demand for a poll shall not prevent the continuance of a meeting for the transaction of any business other than the question on which the poll has been demanded and it may be withdrawn at any time before the close of the meeting or the taking of the poll, whichever is the earlier. Voting on a poll 72. On a poll votes may be cast either personally or by proxy. 73. A person entitled to more than one vote on a poll need not use all his votes or cast all the votes he uses in the same way. 74. On a show of hands, every Member present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall have one vote. On a poll, every Member present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall have one vote for each Share of which he is the registered holder. 17 75. In the case of joint holders of a Share, the vote of the senior who tTerminationers a vote, whether in person or by proxy, shall be accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint holders; and for this purpose seniority shall be determined by the order in which the names stand in the Register of Members in respect of the joint holding. 76. A Member of unsound mind, or, in respect of whom an order has been made by any court having jurisdiction in lunacy, may vote, whether on a show of hands or on a poll, by his receiver, committee, curator bonis or other person of similar nature appointed by such court, and any such receiver, committee, curator bonis or other person may vote by proxy and may otherwise act and be treated as such Member for the purpose of the general meetings. 77. No Member, unless the Directors otherwise determine, shall be entitled to vote at any general meeting, unless all calls or other sums presently payable by him in respect of Shares in the Company have been paid. 78. No objection shall be raised as to the qualification of any voter or as to whether any votes have been properly counted except at the general meeting or adjourned general meeting at which the vote objected to is given or tTerminationered and every vote not disallowed at the meeting shall be valid. Any objection made in due time and in accordance with these Articles shall be referred to the chairman whose decision shall be final and conclusive. Shareholder Restricted Matters 78A.

Such Secretary or other officers need not be Directors and in the case of the other officers may be ascribed such titles as the Directors may decide and the Directors may revoke or terminate any such election or appointment. Any such revocation or termination shall be without prejudice to any claim for any damages that such officer may have against the Company or the Company may have against such officer for any breach of any contract of service between him and the Company which may be involved in such revocation or termination.

DIVIDTerminationS Payment of DividTerminations 134. The Directors may from time to time declare dividTerminations to be paid to the Members according to their rights and interests, including such interim dividTerminations as appear to the Directors to be justified by the position of the Company. The Directors may also pay any fixed cash dividTermination which is payable on any Shares of the Company half yearly or on such other dates, whenever the position of the Company, in the opinion of the Directors, justifies such payment. 135. No dividTermination shall be paid otherwise than out of profits or out of monies otherwise available for dividTermination in accordance with the Law. Calculation of DividTerminations 136. Subject to the rights of Members, if any, entitled to Shares with special rights as to dividTerminations, all dividTerminations shall be declared and paid according to the amount paid up on the Shares in respect of which the dividTermination is paid and any dividTermination on any class of Shares not fully paid shall be declared and paid according to the amounts paid on the Shares of that class, but if and so long as nothing is paid up on any of the Shares in the Company, dividTerminations may be declared and paid according to the number of Shares. No amount paid on a Share in advance of calls shall, while carrying interest, be treated for the purposes of this Article as paid on the Share. DividTerminations may be apportioned and paid pro rata according to the amounts paid-up on the Shares during any portion or portions of the period in respect of which the dividTermination is paid. 31 Deductions 137. The Directors may deduct from any dividTermination, distribution or other monies payable to a Member by the Company on or in respect of any Shares all sums of money (if any) presently payable by him to the Company on account of calls or otherwise in respect of Shares of the Company. Joint Holders 138. If several persons are registered as joint holders of any Share, any of them may give effectual receipts for any dividTermination or other money payable on or in respect of the Share. Payment method 139. Any dividTermination may be paid by cheque or warrant sent through the post to the address of the Member or person entitled thereto in the Register of Members or, in the case of joint holders addressed to the holder whose name stands first in the Register of Members in respect of the Shares at his registered address as appearing on the Register of Members or to such person and such address as the Member or person entitled or such joint holders as the case may be may direct in writing. Every such cheque or warrant shall, unless the holder or joint holders may in writing direct, be made payable to the order of the person to whom it is sent or to the order of the holder or, in the case of joint holders, to the order of the holder whose name stands first in the Register of Members in respect of such Shares, and shall be sent at his or their risk and payment of the cheque or warrant by the bank on which it is drawn shall constitute a good discharge to the Company. Any one of two or more joint holders may give effectual receipts for any dividTerminations, distributions or other monies payable or property distributable in respect of the Shares held by such joint holders. Satisfaction by distribution of specific assets 140. The Directors may declare that any dividTermination or distribution is paid wholly or partly by the distribution of specific assets and, in particular, of paid up shares, debentures or debenture stock of any other company or in any one or more of such ways, and where any difficulty arises in regard to such dividTermination or distribution, the Directors may settle the same as they think expedient, and in particular may issue fractional Shares or ignore fractions altogether and may fix the value for dividTermination or distribution of such specific assets or any part thereof and may determine that cash payments shall be made to any Members upon the basis of the value so fixed in order to secure equality of distribution, and may vest any such specific assets in trustees as may seem expedient to the Directors. 32 No interest 141. No dividTermination or other distribution or other monies payable by the Company on or in respect of any Share shall bear interest against the Company. Unclaimed dividTerminations 142. All unclaimed dividTerminations or distributions may be invested or otherwise made use of by the Directors for the benefit of the Company until claimed. Any dividTermination or distribution unclaimed by a Member six years after the dividTermination or distribution payment date shall be forfeited and revert to the Company. RESERVES 143. The Directors may, before declaring any dividTermination or distribution, set aside such sums as they think proper as a reserve or reserves which shall, at the discretion of the Directors, be applicable for meeting contingencies, or for equalising dividTerminations, or for any other purpose of the Company, and pTerminationing such application may, in their discretion, be employed in the business of the Company or be invested in such manner as the Directors may from time to time think fit. The Directors may also without placing the same to reserve carry forward any sums which they think it prudent not to distribute. CAPITALISATION OF PROFITS Capitalisation 144. The Directors may capitalise any sum standing to the credit of any of the Company’s reserve accounts which are available for distribution (including its Share Premium Account and capital redemption reserve fund, subject to the Law) or any sum standing to the credit of the profit and loss account or otherwise available for distribution and to appropriate such sums to Members in the proportions in which such sum would have been divisible amongst them had the same been a distribution of profits by way of dividTermination and to apply such sum on their behalf in paying up in full unissued Shares for allotment and distribution credited as fully paid-up to and amongst them in the proportion aforesaid. Authorisation 145. Where any difficulty arises in regard to any distribution under the last preceding Article, the Directors may settle the same as they think expedient and, in particular, may authorise any person to sell and Assignment any fractions or may resolve that the distribution should be as nearly as may be practicable in the correct proportion but not exactly so or may ignore fractions altogether, and may determine that cash payments should be made to any Members in order to adjust the rights of all parties, as may seem expedient to the Directors. The Directors may appoint any person to sign on behalf of the persons entitled to participate in the distribution any contract necessary or desirable for giving effect thereto and such appointment shall be effective and binding upon the Members. 33 SHARE PREMIUM ACCOUNT 146. The Directors shall in accordance with the Law establish a Share Premium Account and shall carry to the credit of such account from time to time a sum equal to the amount or value of the premium paid on the issue of any Share. 147. There shall be debited to any Share Premium Account on the redemption or purchase of a Share the difference between the nominal value of such Share and the redemption or purchase price provided always that at the discretion of the Directors such sum may be paid out of the profits of the Company or, if permitted by the Law, out of capital.

Inspection by Members 149. The accounting records shall be kept at the Registered Office or at such other place or places as the Directors think fit, and shall at all times be open to inspection by the Directors.

A notice may be given by the Company to the person entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a Member by sTerminationing it through the post in a prepaid letter addressed to them by name, or by the title of representatives of the deceased, or trustee of the bankrupt, or by any like description, at the address, if any, supplied for the purpose by the persons claiming to be so entitled, or (until such an address has been so supplied) by giving the notice in any manner in which the same might have been given if the death or bankruptcy had not occurred. 154. Notice of every general meeting shall be given in any manner hereinbefore authorised to: 154.1 every Member entitled to vote except those Members entitled to vote who (having no registered address) have not supplied to the Company an address for the giving of notices to them; and 154.2 every person entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a Member, who, but for his death or bankruptcy would be entitled to receive notice of the meeting. 155. No other persons shall be entitled to receive notices of general meeting. 35 WINDING UP Method of winding up 156. Subject to the rights attaching to any Shares, if the Company shall be wound up, the liquidator may, with the sanction of a Special Resolution and any other sanction required by the Law or these Articles, divide amongst the Members in kind the whole or any part of the assets of the Company (whether they shall consist of property of the same kind or not) and may for such purpose set such value as he deems fair upon any property to be divided as aforesaid and may determine how such division shall be carried out as between the Members or different classes of Members. The liquidator may, with the like sanction, vest the whole or any part of such assets in trustees upon such trusts for the benefit of the contributories as the liquidator, with the like sanction, shall think fit, but so that no Member shall be compelled to accept any asset upon which there is any liability. Distribution of assets 157. If the Company shall be wound up and the assets available for distribution amongst the Members as such shall be insufficient to repay the whole of the paid up capital, such assets shall be distributed so that, as nearly as may be, the losses shall be borne by the Members in proportion to the capital paid up, or which ought to have been paid up, at the commencement of the winding up, on the Shares held by them respectively. And if in a winding up the assets available for distribution amongst the Members shall be more than sufficient to repay the whole of the capital paid up at the commencement of the winding up, the excess shall be distributed amongst the Members in proportion to the capital paid up at the commencement of the winding up on the Shares held by them respectively. This Article is to be without prejudice to the rights of the holders of Shares issued upon special terms and conditions. Indemnification Indemnification and limitation of liability 158. Every Indemnified Person shall, in the absence of wilful neglect or default, be indemnified and held harmless out of the assets of the Company against all liabilities, loss, damage, cost or expense (including but not limited to liabilities under contract, tort and statute or any applicable foreign law or regulation and all reasonable legal and other costs and expenses on a full Indemnification basis properly payable) incurred or suffered by him by or by reason of any act done, conceived in or omitted in the conduct of the Company’s business or in the discharge of his duties and the Indemnification contained in this Article shall extTermination to any Indemnified Person acting in any office or trust in the reasonable belief that he has been appointed or elected to such office or trust notwithstanding any defect in such appointment or election. 36 159. No Indemnified Person shall be liable to the Company for acts, defaults or omissions of any other Indemnified Person. Indemnification and reimbursement 160. Every Indemnified Person shall be indemnified out of the funds of the Company against all liabilities incurred by him by or by reason of any act done, conceived in or omitted in the conduct of the Company’s business or in the discharge of his duties in defTerminationing any proceedings, whether civil or criminal, in which judgment is given in his favour, or in which he is acquitted, or in connection with any application in which relief from liability is granted to him by the court. 161. To the extent that any Indemnified Person is entitled to claim an Indemnification pursuant to these Articles in respect of amounts paid or discharged by him, the relative Indemnification shall take effect as an obligation of the Company to reimburse the person making such payment or effecting such discharge. Wilful neglect or default 162. Each Member and the Company agree to waive any claim or right of action he or it may at any time have, whether individually or by or in the right of the Company, against any Indemnified Person on account of any act or omission of such Indemnified Person in the performance of his duties for the Company; provided however, that such waiver shall not apply to any claims or rights of action arising out of the wilful neglect or default of such Indemnified Person or to recover any gain, personal profit or advantage to which such Indemnified Person is not legally entitled. Advance of legal fees 163. Expenses incurred in defTerminationing any civil or criminal action or proceeding for which indemnification is required pursuant to these Articles shall be paid by the Company in advance of the final disposition of such action or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnified Person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that the Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified pursuant to these Articles. Each Member of the Company shall be deemed to have acknowledged and agreed that the advances of funds may be made by the Company as aforesaid, and when made by the Company under this Article are made to meet expTerminationitures incurred for the purpose of enabling such Indemnified Person to properly perform his or her duties to the Company. 37 CONTINUATION 164. The Company shall have the power, subject to the provisions of the Law and with the approval of a Special Resolution, to continue as a body incorporated under the laws of any jurisdiction outside of the Cayman Islands and to be de-registered in the Cayman Islands. AMTerminationMENT OF MEMORANDUM AND ARTICLES Subject to the provisions of the Law, the Company may from time to time by Special Resolution alter or amTermination the Memorandum or these Articles in whole or in part provided that no such amTerminationment shall affect the special rights attaching to any class of Shares without the consent or sanction provided for in these Articles.

The Directors may fix in advance a date as the record date to determine the Members entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of the Members and, for the purpose of determining the Members entitled to receive payment of any dividTermination, the Directors may, at or within 90 days prior to the date of the declaration of such dividTermination, fix a subsequent date as the record date for such determination. No fixed record date 11. If no such record date is fixed, the record date shall be the date on which notice of the meeting is sent or the date on which the resolution of the Directors declaring such dividTermination is adopted, as the case may be. A determination of Members entitled to vote at any meeting of Members in accordance with this Article, shall apply to any adjournment thereof. SHARE CERTIFICATES Issue of Share Certificates 12. Every Member shall be entitled, without payment, to a certificate of the Company specifying the Share or Shares held by him and the amount paid up thereon. 13. Notwithstanding the provisions of these Articles, the Directors may resolve not to issue share certificates to Members of the Company. Certificates for jointly-held Shares 14. The Company shall not be bound to issue more than one certificate for Shares held jointly by more than one person, and delivery of a certificate to one joint holder shall be sufficient delivery to all. Replacement Share Certificates 15. If a share certificate is defaced, lost or destroyed, it may be replaced on payment of such fee (if any) and on such terms (if any) as to evidence and Indemnification, and on the payment of expenses of the Company in investigating such evidence and preparing such Indemnification as the Directors shall think fit and, in case of defacement, on delivery of the old certificate to the Company for cancellation. 6 Assignment OF SHARES Instrument of Assignment 16. The instrument of Assignment of any Share shall be executed by or on behalf of the Assignmentor (and, if the Directors so determine, the Assignmentee). The Assignmentor shall be deemed to remain the holder of the Share until the name of the Assignmentee is entered in the Register of Members in respect of such Share. All instruments of Assignment, once registered, may be retained by the Company. 17. Subject to any applicable restrictions contained in these Articles, Shares shall be Assignmentred in any usual or common form approved by the Directors. Refusal to register Assignments 18. The Directors may, in their absolute discretion and without assigning any reason therefore, decline to register any Assignment of any Share. The Directors may require reasonable evidence to show the right of the Assignmentor to make the Assignment. 19. If the Directors decline to register a Assignment of Shares they shall sTermination notice of the refusal to the Assignmentee within one month after the date on which the Assignment was lodged with the Company. 20. The Directors may also suspTermination the registration of the Assignments at such times and for such periods as the Directors may from time to time determine. TRANSMISSION OF SHARES Transmission of Shares 21. If a Member dies, the survivor or survivors (where he was a joint holder), and the legal personal representative (where he was sole holder), shall be the only person recognised by the Company as having any title to the Share. The estate of a deceased Member is not thereby released from any liability in respect of any Share held by him, whether solely or jointly. For the purpose of this Article, legal personal representative means the person to whom probate or letters of administration has or have been granted in the Cayman Islands or, if there is no such person, such other person as the Directors may in their absolute discretion determine to be the person recognised by the Company for the purpose of this Article. Election by persons entitled on transmission 22. Any person becoming entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a Member or otherwise by operation of Governing Law may elect, upon such evidence being produced as may be required by the Directors as to his entitlement, either be registered himself as a Member in respect of the Share or, instead of being registered himself, to make such Assignment of the Share as the deceased or bankrupt Member could have made. 7 Manner of election 23. If the person so becoming entitled elects to be registered himself, he shall deliver or sTermination to the Company a notice in writing signed by him stating that he so elects. If he shall elect to Assignment the Shares, he shall signify his election by signing an instrument of Assignment of such Shares in favour of his Assignmentee. All the limitations, restrictions and provisions of these Articles relating to the right to Assignment and the registration of Assignments of Shares shall be applicable to any such notice or instrument of Assignment as aforesaid as if the death of the Member or other event giving rise to the transmission had not occurred and the notice or instrument of Assignment was an instrument of Assignment signed by such Member. Rights of persons entitled on transmission 24. A person becoming entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of the Member (or otherwise by operation of Governing Law), upon such evidence being produced as may be required by the Directors as to his entitlement, shall be entitled to the same dividTerminations and other monies payable in respect of the Share as he would be entitled if he were the holder of such Share. However, he shall not be entitled, until he becomes registered as the holder of such Share, to receive notices of or to attTermination or vote at general meetings of the Company or (except as aforesaid) to exercise any other rights or privileges of a Member. The Directors may at any time give notice requiring such person to elect either to be registered himself or to Assignment the Share and, if the notice is not complied with within sixty days, the Directors may thereafter withhold payment of all dividTerminations and other monies payable in respect of the Shares until the requirements of the notice have been complied with. REDEMPTION AND PURCHASE OF SHARES 25. Subject to the provisions of the Law and the Memorandum, the Company may: 25.1 purchase its own Shares (including any redeemable Shares) in such manner and on such terms as the Directors may agree with the relevant Member unless following such purchase there would no longer be any issued Shares and may make payment for such purchase or for any redemption of Shares in any manner authorised by the Law, including out of capital; and 25.2 reduce its share capital and any capital redemption reserve fund in any manner whatsoever. 8 VARIATION OF SHARE RIGHTS Variation of class rights 26. If at any time the share capital is divided into different classes of Shares, all or any of the special rights attached to any class of Shares (unless otherwise provided by the terms of issue of the Shares of that class) may be varied or abrogated with the consent in writing of the holders of not less than two thirds of the issued Shares of that class or with the sanction of a resolution passed by the holders of not less than two thirds of the issued Shares of that class as may be present in person or by proxy at a separate general meeting of the holders of the Shares of that class. To any such separate general meeting, all of the provisions of these Articles relating to general meetings shall mutatis mutandis apply, but so that the necessary quorum shall be any one or more persons holding or representing by proxy not less than one third of the issued Shares of the class and that any holder of Shares of the relevant class present in person or by proxy may demand a poll. Treatment of classes 27. For the purpose of a separate class meeting, the Directors may treat two or more of all classes of Shares as forming one class if they consider that such class of Shares would be affected in the same way by the proposals under consideration. Effect of Share issue on class rights 28. The rights conferred upon the holders of any Shares shall not, unless otherwise expressly provided in the rights attaching to such Shares, be deemed to be altered by the creation or issue of further Shares ranking pari passu therewith. NON-RECOGNITION OF TRUSTS 29. Except as required by the Law or these Articles, or under an order of a court of competent jurisdiction, the Company shall not be bound by or compelled to recognise in any way, even when notice thereof is given to it, any equitable, contingent, future or partial interest in any Share, or any other rights in respect of any Share other than an absolute right to the entirety thereof in the registered holder. 9 LIEN Lien generally 30. The Company shall have a first and paramount lien on every Share (not being a fully paid Share) for all moneys (whether presently payable or not) called or payable at a date fixed by or in accordance with the terms of issue of such Share in respect of that Share, and the Company shall also have a first and paramount lien on every Share (other than a fully paid up Share) standing registered in the name of a Member, whether singly or jointly with any other person for all debts and liabilities of a Member or his estate to the Company, whether the same shall have been incurred before or after notice to the Company of any interest of any person other than such Member, and whether the time for the payment or discharge of the same shall have actually arrived or not, and notwithstanding that the same are joint debts or liabilities of such Member or his estate and any other person, whether a Member or not. The Directors may at any time, either generally or in any particular case, waive any lien that has arisen or declare any Share to be wholly or in part exempt from the provisions of this Article. The Company's lien, if any, on a Share shall extTermination to all dividTerminations payable thereon. Enforcement 31. The Company may sell, in such manner as the Directors think fit, any Share on which the Company has a lien, provided a sum in respect of which the lien exists is presently payable, and is not paid within fourteen days after a notice in writing has been given to the registered holder  for the time being of the Share, demanding payment of the sum presently payable and giving notice of the intention to sell in default of such payment. Completion of sale 32. For giving effect to any such sale, the Directors may authorise any person to Assignment the Share sold to the purchaser thereof. The purchaser shall be registered as the holder of the Share comprised in any such Assignment and he shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money, nor shall his title to the Share be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings relating to the sale. Application of proceeds 33. The net proceeds of such sale shall be applied in payment or discharge of the debt or liability in respect of which the lien exists and as is presently payable, and any balance shall (subject to a like lien for debts or liabilities not presently payable as existed upon the Shares prior to the sale) be paid to the person who was the registered holder of the Share immediately before such sale. CALLS ON SHARES Calls on Shares generally 34. The Directors may from time to time make calls upon the Members in respect of any moneys unpaid on their Shares (whether in respect of the par value of the Shares or premium or otherwise and not, by the terms of issue thereof, made payable at a future date fixed by or in accordance with such terms of issue); and each Member shall (subject to the Company serving upon him at least 14 days’ notice specifying the time or times and place of payment) pay to the Company at the time or times and place so specified the amount called on his Shares. A call may be revoked or postponed by the Directors wholly or in part as the Directors may determine. A call shall be deemed to have been made at the time when the resolution of the Directors authorising the call was passed. 10 Payment 35. Payment of a call may be made by instalments on the direction of the Directors. 36. If a sum called in respect of a Share is not paid before or on the day appointed for payment thereof, the person from whom the sum is due shall pay interest on the sum from the day payment is due to the time of the actual payment at such rate as the Directors may determine, but the Directors may waive payment of such interest wholly or in part. 37. Any sum payable in respect of a Share on issue or allotment or at any fixed date, whether in respect of the par value of the Share or premium or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a call and if it is not paid all the relevant provisions as to payment of interest, forfeiture or otherwise of these Articles shall apply as if such sum had become due and payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified. 38. The Directors may issue Shares with different terms as to the amount and times of payment of calls. Liability of joint holders 39. The joint holders of a Share shall be jointly and severally liable to pay calls in respect thereof. Interest 40. The Directors may, if they think fit, receive from any Member willing to advance the same, all or any part of the moneys uncalled and unpaid upon any Shares held by him; and may (until the amount would otherwise become payable) pay interest at such rate (not exceeding six per cent without the sanction of the Company in general meeting) as may be agreed upon between the Member paying the sum in advance and the Directors. FORFEITURE OF SHARES Notice 41. If a Member fails to pay any call or instalment of a call by the date it becomes due and payable, the Directors may, at any time thereafter while such call or instalment remains unpaid, give notice to the Member requiring payment of the unpaid portion of the call or instalment, together with any accrued interest and expenses incurred by the Company by reason of such non-payment. 11 42. The notice shall specify where and by what date (not being less than the Termination of 14 days’ from the date of the notice) payment is to be made and shall state that if it is not complied with the Shares in respect of which the call was made will be liable to be forfeited. The Directors may accept the surrTerminationer of any Share liable to be forfeited hereunder and, in such case, references to these Articles to forfeiture shall include surrTerminationer. Forfeiture for non-compliance 43. If such notice is not complied with, any Share in respect of which the notice was given may thereafter, before the payment of all calls or instalments and interest due in respect thereof has been made, be forfeited by a resolution of the Directors. Such forfeiture shall include all dividTerminations declared, other distributions or other monies payable in respect of the forfeited Shares and not paid before the forfeiture. Forfeited Shares 44. A forfeited Share may be sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed of upon such terms and in such manner as the Directors shall think fit, and at any time before a sale, re-allotment or disposition, the forfeiture may be cancelled on such terms as the Directors think fit. Continued liability for forfeited Member 45. A person whose Shares have been forfeited shall cease to be a Member in respect of the forfeited Shares, but shall remain liable to pay to the Company all moneys which at the date of forfeiture were presently payable by him in respect of the Shares together with interest at such rate as the Directors may determine from the date of forfeiture until payment, but his liability shall cease if and when the Company receives payment in full of all amounts due in respect of the Shares. The Company may enforce payment without being under any obligation to make any allowance for the value of the Shares forfeited. Evidence of forfeiture 46. An affidavit in writing by a Director or Secretary of the Company that a Share has been duly forfeited on a specified date, shall be conclusive evidence of the facts stated in it as against all persons claiming to be entitled to the Share. The Company may receive the consideration, if any, given for the Share on any sale, re-allotment or disposition thereof and may authorise some person to execute a Assignment of the Share in favour of the person to whom the Share is sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed of, and he shall thereupon be registered as the holder of the Share, and shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money (if any) nor shall his title to the Share be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings in reference to the forfeiture, sale, re-allotment or disposition of the Share. 12 47. The provisions of these Articles as to forfeiture shall apply in the case of non-payment of any sum which, by the terms of issue of a Share, becomes payable at a fixed time, whether on account of the par value of the Share, or by way of premium or otherwise, as if the same had been made payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified to the Member. INCREASE OF CAPITAL 48. The Company may from time to time by Ordinary Resolution increase its share capital by such sum, to be divided into new Shares of such par value, and with such rights, priorities and privileges attached thereto as the resolution shall prescribe. 49. Subject to any directions given by the Company in a general meeting, all new Shares shall be at the disposal of the Directors in accordance with these Articles. 50. The new Shares shall be subject to the same provisions of these Articles with reference to the payment of calls, lien, forfeiture, Assignment, transmission and otherwise, as the Shares in the original share capital. ALTERATION OF CAPITAL 51. The Company may from time to time by Ordinary Resolution: 51.1 consolidate and divide all or any of its share capital into Shares of larger par value than its existing Shares; 51.2 sub divide its existing Shares, or any of them, into Shares of smaller par value than is fixed by the Memorandum, subject nevertheless to the provisions of section 13 of the Law; 51.3 cancel any Shares which, at the date of the passing of the resolution, have not been taken or agreed to be taken by any person; and 51.4 convert all or any paid up Shares into stock, and reconvert all or any stock into paid up Shares of any denomination. 52. The Company may from time to time by Special Resolution: 52.1 divide its Shares into several classes and attach to such classes any preferential, deferred, or special rights or restrictions in accordance with these Articles; 52.2 change the currency denomination of its share capital; 13 52.3 reduce its share capital and any capital redemption reserve fund in any manner whatsoever; and 52.4 merge or consolidate with any one or more constituent companies (as defined in the Law). GENERAL MEETINGS Convening a meeting 53. The Directors may, whenever they think fit, convene an extraordinary general meeting. If at any time there are not sufficient Directors capable of acting to form a quorum, any Director, or any one or more Members holding in the aggregate not less than one third of the total issued share capital of the Company entitled to vote, may convene an extraordinary general meeting in the same manner as nearly as possible as that in which meetings may be convened by the Directors. Members’ requisition 54. The Directors shall, upon the requisition in writing of one or more Members holding in the aggregate not less than one tenth of such paid up capital of the Company as at the date of the requisition carries the right of voting at general meetings, convene an extraordinary general meeting. Any such requisition shall express the object of the meeting proposed to be called, and must be signed by the requisitionists and deposited at the Registered Office, and may consist of several documents in like form, each signed by one or more requisitionists. 55. If there are no Directors as at the date of the deposit of the Members’ requisition or if the Directors do not convene a general meeting within 21 days from the date of the deposit, the requisitionists or any or any of them or any other Member or Members holding in the aggregate not less than one tenth of such paid up capital of the Company as at the date of the requisition, may convene an extraordinary general meeting. A general meeting convened by requisitionists shall be convened in the same manner as nearly as possible as that in which general meetings are to be convened by the Directors. NOTICE OF GENERAL MEETINGS Length and form of notice 56. At least five clear days’ notice shall be given of any general meeting. Every notice shall specify the place, the day and the time of meeting and, in the case of special business, the general nature of the business to be conducted at the general meeting, and shall be given in the manner provided in these Articles or in such other manner (if any) as may be prescribed by the Company, to such persons as are entitled to receive such notices from the Company. A general meeting may be convened by such shorter notice, or without notice, by a majority in number of the Members having the right to attTermination and vote at the meeting, being a majority together holding not less than ninety-five percent in nominal value of the Shares giving that right. 14 Omission or non-receipt 57. The accidental omission to give notice of a meeting to, or the non-receipt of a notice of a meeting by, any Member entitled to receive notice shall not invalidate the proceedings at any meeting. PROCEEDINGS AT GENERAL MEETINGS 58. All business shall be deemed special that is transacted at an extraordinary general meeting. Quorum 59. No business shall be transacted at any general meeting unless a quorum of Members is present at the time that the meeting proceeds to business, but the absence of a quorum shall not preclude the appointment, choice or election of a chairman, which shall not be treated as part of the business of the Meeting. Save as herein otherwise provided, one or more Members holding in the aggregate not less than one third of the total issued share capital of the Company present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall be a quorum. Adjournment for lack of quorum 60. If within five minutes (or such longer time as the chairman of the meeting may determine to wait) after the time appointed for the meeting, a quorum is not present, the meeting, if convened upon the requisition of Members, shall be dissolved. In any other case, it shall stand adjourned to the same day in the next week, at the same time and place, and if at the adjourned meeting a quorum is not present within half an hour from the time appointed for the meeting, the Members present shall be a quorum. Meeting by telephone or other facilities 61. A meeting of the Members may be held by telephone, electronic or other communication facilities (including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, by telephone or video conferencing) by which all persons participating in the meeting can communicate with each other simultaneously and instantaneously, and participation in such a general meeting shall constitute presence in person at such meeting. 62. Any Director shall be entitled to attTermination and speak at any general meeting of the Company. 15 Appointment of chairman 63. The chairman (if any) of the Board of Directors shall preside as chairman at every general meeting of the Company. If there is no such chairman, or if at any meeting he is not present within five minutes after the time appointed for holding the meeting or is unwilling to act as chairman, the Directors present shall choose one of their number to act or, if only one Director is present, he shall preside as chairman if willing to act. If no Director is present, or if each of the Directors present declines to take the chair, the Members present and entitled to vote shall elect one of their number to be chairman. Adjournment of meeting 64. The chairman may, with the consent of a meeting at which a quorum is present (and shall if so directed by the meeting) adjourn the meeting from time to time and from place to place, but no business shall be transacted at any adjourned meeting other than the business left unfinished at the meeting from which the adjournment took place. When a meeting is adjourned for ten days or more, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given as in the case of an original meeting. Save as aforesaid, it shall not be necessary to give any notice of an adjournment or of the business to be transacted at an adjourned meeting. VOTING Ordinary Resolution Save where a Special Resolution or other greater majority is required by the Law or these Articles, any question proposed for consideration at any general meeting shall be decided by an Ordinary Resolution. Voting on a show of hands 65. At any general meeting, a resolution put to the vote of the meeting shall be decided on a show of hands, unless before or on the declaration of the result of the show of hands, or on the withdrawal of any other demand for a poll. Demand for poll 66. A poll is demanded by: 66.1 the chairman of the meeting; or 66.2 at least three Members present in person or by proxy; or 66.3 any Member or Members present in person or by proxy and holding collectively not less than one tenth of the total voting rights of all the Members having the right to vote at such meeting; or 16 66.4 a Member or Members present in person or by proxy holding Shares conferring the right to vote at such meeting, being Shares on which an aggregate sum has been paid up equal to not less than one tenth of the total sum paid up on all such Shares conferring such right. 67. Unless a poll is duly demanded and the demand is not withdrawn, a declaration by the chairman that a resolution has, on a show of hands, been carried or carried unanimously, or by a particular majority, or lost and an entry to that effect in the minutes of the proceedings of the Company shall be conclusive evidence of that fact, without proof of the number or proportion of the votes recorded in favour of, or against, that resolution. The demand for a poll may be withdrawn by the person or any persons making it at any time prior to the declaration of the result of the poll. 68. If a poll is duly demanded, it shall be taken in such manner as the chairman directs, and the result of the poll shall be deemed to be the resolution of the meeting at which the poll was demanded. 69. In the case of an equality of votes at a general meeting, whether on a show of hands or on a poll, the chairman of the meeting at which the show of hands takes place or at which the poll is demanded, shall not be entitled to a second or casting vote and the resolution shall fail. 70. A poll demanded on the election of a chairman or on a question of adjournment shall be taken forthwith.

A committee may meet and adjourn as it thinks proper. Questions arising at any meeting shall be determined by a majority of votes of the members present and in case of an equality of votes the chairman shall not have a second or casting vote and the motion shall be deemed to have been lost. Officers 127. The Directors may appoint a Secretary and such other officers as they may from time to time consider necessary upon such terms as to duration of office, remuneration and otherwise as they may think fit. Such Secretary or other officers need not be Directors and in the case of the other officers may be ascribed such titles as the Directors may decide and the Directors may revoke or terminate any such election or appointment. Any such revocation or termination shall be without prejudice to any claim for any damages that such officer may have against the Company or the Company may have against such officer for any breach of any contract of service between him and the Company which may be involved in such revocation or termination.

DIVIDTerminationS Payment of DividTerminations 134. The Directors may from time to time declare dividTerminations to be paid to the Members according to their rights and interests, including such interim dividTerminations as appear to the Directors to be justified by the position of the Company. The Directors may also pay any fixed cash dividTermination which is payable on any Shares of the Company half yearly or on such other dates, whenever the position of the Company, in the opinion of the Directors, justifies such payment. 135. No dividTermination shall be paid otherwise than out of profits or out of monies otherwise available for dividTermination in accordance with the Law. Calculation of DividTerminations 136. Subject to the rights of Members, if any, entitled to Shares with special rights as to dividTerminations, all dividTerminations shall be declared and paid according to the amount paid up on the Shares in respect of which the dividTermination is paid and any dividTermination on any class of Shares not fully paid shall be declared and paid according to the amounts paid on the Shares of that class, but if and so long as nothing is paid up on any of the Shares in the Company, dividTerminations may be declared and paid according to the number of Shares. No amount paid on a Share in advance of calls shall, while carrying interest, be treated for the purposes of this Article as paid on the Share. DividTerminations may be apportioned and paid pro rata according to the amounts paid-up on the Shares during any portion or portions of the period in respect of which the dividTermination is paid. 31 Deductions 137. The Directors may deduct from any dividTermination, distribution or other monies payable to a Member by the Company on or in respect of any Shares all sums of money (if any) presently payable by him to the Company on account of calls or otherwise in respect of Shares of the Company. Joint Holders 138. If several persons are registered as joint holders of any Share, any of them may give effectual receipts for any dividTermination or other money payable on or in respect of the Share. Payment method 139. Any dividTermination may be paid by cheque or warrant sent through the post to the address of the Member or person entitled thereto in the Register of Members or, in the case of joint holders addressed to the holder whose name stands first in the Register of Members in respect of the Shares at his registered address as appearing on the Register of Members or to such person and such address as the Member or person entitled or such joint holders as the case may be may direct in writing. Every such cheque or warrant shall, unless the holder or joint holders may in writing direct, be made payable to the order of the person to whom it is sent or to the order of the holder or, in the case of joint holders, to the order of the holder whose name stands first in the Register of Members in respect of such Shares, and shall be sent at his or their risk and payment of the cheque or warrant by the bank on which it is drawn shall constitute a good discharge to the Company. Any one of two or more joint holders may give effectual receipts for any dividTerminations, distributions or other monies payable or property distributable in respect of the Shares held by such joint holders. Satisfaction by distribution of specific assets 140. The Directors may declare that any dividTermination or distribution is paid wholly or partly by the distribution of specific assets and, in particular, of paid up shares, debentures or debenture stock of any other company or in any one or more of such ways, and where any difficulty arises in regard to such dividTermination or distribution, the Directors may settle the same as they think expedient, and in particular may issue fractional Shares or ignore fractions altogether and may fix the value for dividTermination or distribution of such specific assets or any part thereof and may determine that cash payments shall be made to any Members upon the basis of the value so fixed in order to secure equality of distribution, and may vest any such specific assets in trustees as may seem expedient to the Directors. 32 No interest 141. No dividTermination or other distribution or other monies payable by the Company on or in respect of any Share shall bear interest against the Company. Unclaimed dividTerminations 142. All unclaimed dividTerminations or distributions may be invested or otherwise made use of by the Directors for the benefit of the Company until claimed. Any dividTermination or distribution unclaimed by a Member six years after the dividTermination or distribution payment date shall be forfeited and revert to the Company. RESERVES 143. The Directors may, before declaring any dividTermination or distribution, set aside such sums as they think proper as a reserve or reserves which shall, at the discretion of the Directors, be applicable for meeting contingencies, or for equalising dividTerminations, or for any other purpose of the Company, and pTerminationing such application may, in their discretion, be employed in the business of the Company or be invested in such manner as the Directors may from time to time think fit. The Directors may also without placing the same to reserve carry forward any sums which they think it prudent not to distribute. CAPITALISATION OF PROFITS Capitalisation 144. The Directors may capitalise any sum standing to the credit of any of the Company’s reserve accounts which are available for distribution (including its Share Premium Account and capital redemption reserve fund, subject to the Law) or any sum standing to the credit of the profit and loss account or otherwise available for distribution and to appropriate such sums to Members in the proportions in which such sum would have been divisible amongst them had the same been a distribution of profits by way of dividTermination and to apply such sum on their behalf in paying up in full unissued Shares for allotment and distribution credited as fully paid-up to and amongst them in the proportion aforesaid. Authorisation 145. Where any difficulty arises in regard to any distribution under the last preceding Article, the Directors may settle the same as they think expedient and, in particular, may authorise any person to sell and Assignment any fractions or may resolve that the distribution should be as nearly as may be practicable in the correct proportion but not exactly so or may ignore fractions altogether, and may determine that cash payments should be made to any Members in order to adjust the rights of all parties, as may seem expedient to the Directors. The Directors may appoint any person to sign on behalf of the persons entitled to participate in the distribution any contract necessary or desirable for giving effect thereto and such appointment shall be effective and binding upon the Members. 33 SHARE PREMIUM ACCOUNT 146. The Directors shall in accordance with the Law establish a Share Premium Account and shall carry to the credit of such account from time to time a sum equal to the amount or value of the premium paid on the issue of any Share. 147. There shall be debited to any Share Premium Account on the redemption or purchase of a Share the difference between the nominal value of such Share and the redemption or purchase price provided always that at the discretion of the Directors such sum may be paid out of the profits of the Company or, if permitted by the Law, out of capital. ACCOUNTING RECORDS Books of account 148.

Subject to the rights attaching to any Shares, if the Company shall be wound up, the liquidator may, with the sanction of a Special Resolution and any other sanction required by the Law or these Articles, divide amongst the Members in kind the whole or any part of the assets of the Company (whether they shall consist of property of the same kind or not) and may for such purpose set such value as he deems fair upon any property to be divided as aforesaid and may determine how such division shall be carried out as between the Members or different classes of Members. The liquidator may, with the like sanction, vest the whole or any part of such assets in trustees upon such trusts for the benefit of the contributories as the liquidator, with the like sanction, shall think fit, but so that no Member shall be compelled to accept any asset upon which there is any liability. Distribution of assets 157. If the Company shall be wound up and the assets available for distribution amongst the Members as such shall be insufficient to repay the whole of the paid up capital, such assets shall be distributed so that, as nearly as may be, the losses shall be borne by the Members in proportion to the capital paid up, or which ought to have been paid up, at the commencement of the winding up, on the Shares held by them respectively. And if in a winding up the assets available for distribution amongst the Members shall be more than sufficient to repay the whole of the capital paid up at the commencement of the winding up, the excess shall be distributed amongst the Members in proportion to the capital paid up at the commencement of the winding up on the Shares held by them respectively. This Article is to be without prejudice to the rights of the holders of Shares issued upon special terms and conditions. Indemnification Indemnification and limitation of liability 158. Every Indemnified Person shall, in the absence of wilful neglect or default, be indemnified and held harmless out of the assets of the Company against all liabilities, loss, damage, cost or expense (including but not limited to liabilities under contract, tort and statute or any applicable foreign law or regulation and all reasonable legal and other costs and expenses on a full Indemnification basis properly payable) incurred or suffered by him by or by reason of any act done, conceived in or omitted in the conduct of the Company’s business or in the discharge of his duties and the Indemnification contained in this Article shall extTermination to any Indemnified Person acting in any office or trust in the reasonable belief that he has been appointed or elected to such office or trust notwithstanding any defect in such appointment or election. 36 159.

Every Indemnified Person shall be indemnified out of the funds of the Company against all liabilities incurred by him by or by reason of any act done, conceived in or omitted in the conduct of the Company’s business or in the discharge of his duties in defTerminationing any proceedings, whether civil or criminal, in which judgment is given in his favour, or in which he is acquitted, or in connection with any application in which relief from liability is granted to him by the court. 161. To the extent that any Indemnified Person is entitled to claim an Indemnification pursuant to these Articles in respect of amounts paid or discharged by him, the relative Indemnification shall take effect as an obligation of the Company to reimburse the person making such payment or effecting such discharge. Wilful neglect or default 162. Each Member and the Company agree to waive any claim or right of action he or it may at any time have, whether individually or by or in the right of the Company, against any Indemnified Person on account of any act or omission of such Indemnified Person in the performance of his duties for the Company; provided however, that such waiver shall not apply to any claims or rights of action arising out of the wilful neglect or default of such Indemnified Person or to recover any gain, personal profit or advantage to which such Indemnified Person is not legally entitled. Advance of legal fees 163. Expenses incurred in defTerminationing any civil or criminal action or proceeding for which indemnification is required pursuant to these Articles shall be paid by the Company in advance of the final disposition of such action or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnified Person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that the Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified pursuant to these Articles. Each Member of the Company shall be deemed to have acknowledged and agreed that the advances of funds may be made by the Company as aforesaid, and when made by the Company under this Article are made to meet expTerminationitures incurred for the purpose of enabling such Indemnified Person to properly perform his or her duties to the Company. 37 CONTINUATION 164. The Company shall have the power, subject to the provisions of the Law and with the approval of a Special Resolution, to continue as a body incorporated under the laws of any jurisdiction outside of the Cayman Islands and to be de-registered in the Cayman Islands.

The Directors may fix in advance a date as the record date to determine the Members entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of the Members and, for the purpose of determining the Members entitled to receive payment of any dividTermination, the Directors may, at or within 90 days prior to the date of the declaration of such dividTermination, fix a subsequent date as the record date for such determination. No fixed record date 11. If no such record date is fixed, the record date shall be the date on which notice of the meeting is sent or the date on which the resolution of the Directors declaring such dividTermination is adopted, as the case may be.

The instrument of Assignment of any Share shall be executed by or on behalf of the Assignmentor (and, if the Directors so determine, the Assignmentee). The Assignmentor shall be deemed to remain the holder of the Share until the name of the Assignmentee is entered in the Register of Members in respect of such Share. All instruments of Assignment, once registered, may be retained by the Company. 17. Subject to any applicable restrictions contained in these Articles, Shares shall be Assignmentred in any usual or common form approved by the Directors. Refusal to register Assignments 18. The Directors may, in their absolute discretion and without assigning any reason therefore, decline to register any Assignment of any Share. The Directors may require reasonable evidence to show the right of the Assignmentor to make the Assignment. 19. If the Directors decline to register a Assignment of Shares they shall sTermination notice of the refusal to the Assignmentee within one month after the date on which the Assignment was lodged with the Company. 20. The Directors may also suspTermination the registration of the Assignments at such times and for such periods as the Directors may from time to time determine. TRANSMISSION OF SHARES Transmission of Shares 21. If a Member dies, the survivor or survivors (where he was a joint holder), and the legal personal representative (where he was sole holder), shall be the only person recognised by the Company as having any title to the Share. The estate of a deceased Member is not thereby released from any liability in respect of any Share held by him, whether solely or jointly. For the purpose of this Article, legal personal representative means the person to whom probate or letters of administration has or have been granted in the Cayman Islands or, if there is no such person, such other person as the Directors may in their absolute discretion determine to be the person recognised by the Company for the purpose of this Article. Election by persons entitled on transmission 22. Any person becoming entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a Member or otherwise by operation of Governing Law may elect, upon such evidence being produced as may be required by the Directors as to his entitlement, either be registered himself as a Member in respect of the Share or, instead of being registered himself, to make such Assignment of the Share as the deceased or bankrupt Member could have made. 7 Manner of election 23. If the person so becoming entitled elects to be registered himself, he shall deliver or sTermination to the Company a notice in writing signed by him stating that he so elects. If he shall elect to Assignment the Shares, he shall signify his election by signing an instrument of Assignment of such Shares in favour of his Assignmentee. All the limitations, restrictions and provisions of these Articles relating to the right to Assignment and the registration of Assignments of Shares shall be applicable to any such notice or instrument of Assignment as aforesaid as if the death of the Member or other event giving rise to the transmission had not occurred and the notice or instrument of Assignment was an instrument of Assignment signed by such Member. Rights of persons entitled on transmission 24. A person becoming entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of the Member (or otherwise by operation of Governing Law), upon such evidence being produced as may be required by the Directors as to his entitlement, shall be entitled to the same dividTerminations and other monies payable in respect of the Share as he would be entitled if he were the holder of such Share. However, he shall not be entitled, until he becomes registered as the holder of such Share, to receive notices of or to attTermination or vote at general meetings of the Company or (except as aforesaid) to exercise any other rights or privileges of a Member. The Directors may at any time give notice requiring such person to elect either to be registered himself or to Assignment the Share and, if the notice is not complied with within sixty days, the Directors may thereafter withhold payment of all dividTerminations and other monies payable in respect of the Shares until the requirements of the notice have been complied with. REDEMPTION AND PURCHASE OF SHARES 25. Subject to the provisions of the Law and the Memorandum, the Company may: 25.1 purchase its own Shares (including any redeemable Shares) in such manner and on such terms as the Directors may agree with the relevant Member unless following such purchase there would no longer be any issued Shares and may make payment for such purchase or for any redemption of Shares in any manner authorised by the Law, including out of capital; and 25.2 reduce its share capital and any capital redemption reserve fund in any manner whatsoever. 8 VARIATION OF SHARE RIGHTS Variation of class rights 26. If at any time the share capital is divided into different classes of Shares, all or any of the special rights attached to any class of Shares (unless otherwise provided by the terms of issue of the Shares of that class) may be varied or abrogated with the consent in writing of the holders of not less than two thirds of the issued Shares of that class or with the sanction of a resolution passed by the holders of not less than two thirds of the issued Shares of that class as may be present in person or by proxy at a separate general meeting of the holders of the Shares of that class. To any such separate general meeting, all of the provisions of these Articles relating to general meetings shall mutatis mutandis apply, but so that the necessary quorum shall be any one or more persons holding or representing by proxy not less than one third of the issued Shares of the class and that any holder of Shares of the relevant class present in person or by proxy may demand a poll. Treatment of classes 27. For the purpose of a separate class meeting, the Directors may treat two or more of all classes of Shares as forming one class if they consider that such class of Shares would be affected in the same way by the proposals under consideration. Effect of Share issue on class rights 28. The rights conferred upon the holders of any Shares shall not, unless otherwise expressly provided in the rights attaching to such Shares, be deemed to be altered by the creation or issue of further Shares ranking pari passu therewith. NON-RECOGNITION OF TRUSTS 29. Except as required by the Law or these Articles, or under an order of a court of competent jurisdiction, the Company shall not be bound by or compelled to recognise in any way, even when notice thereof is given to it, any equitable, contingent, future or partial interest in any Share, or any other rights in respect of any Share other than an absolute right to the entirety thereof in the registered holder. 9 LIEN Lien generally 30. The Company shall have a first and paramount lien on every Share (not being a fully paid Share) for all moneys (whether presently payable or not) called or payable at a date fixed by or in accordance with the terms of issue of such Share in respect of that Share, and the Company shall also have a first and paramount lien on every Share (other than a fully paid up Share) standing registered in the name of a Member, whether singly or jointly with any other person for all debts and liabilities of a Member or his estate to the Company, whether the same shall have been incurred before or after notice to the Company of any interest of any person other than such Member, and whether the time for the payment or discharge of the same shall have actually arrived or not, and notwithstanding that the same are joint debts or liabilities of such Member or his estate and any other person, whether a Member or not. The Directors may at any time, either generally or in any particular case, waive any lien that has arisen or declare any Share to be wholly or in part exempt from the provisions of this Article. The Company's lien, if any, on a Share shall extTermination to all dividTerminations payable thereon. Enforcement 31. The Company may sell, in such manner as the Directors think fit, any Share on which the Company has a lien, provided a sum in respect of which the lien exists is presently payable, and is not paid within fourteen days after a notice in writing has been given to the registered holder  for the time being of the Share, demanding payment of the sum presently payable and giving notice of the intention to sell in default of such payment. Completion of sale 32. For giving effect to any such sale, the Directors may authorise any person to Assignment the Share sold to the purchaser thereof. The purchaser shall be registered as the holder of the Share comprised in any such Assignment and he shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money, nor shall his title to the Share be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings relating to the sale. Application of proceeds 33. The net proceeds of such sale shall be applied in payment or discharge of the debt or liability in respect of which the lien exists and as is presently payable, and any balance shall (subject to a like lien for debts or liabilities not presently payable as existed upon the Shares prior to the sale) be paid to the person who was the registered holder of the Share immediately before such sale. CALLS ON SHARES Calls on Shares generally 34. The Directors may from time to time make calls upon the Members in respect of any moneys unpaid on their Shares (whether in respect of the par value of the Shares or premium or otherwise and not, by the terms of issue thereof, made payable at a future date fixed by or in accordance with such terms of issue); and each Member shall (subject to the Company serving upon him at least 14 days’ notice specifying the time or times and place of payment) pay to the Company at the time or times and place so specified the amount called on his Shares. A call may be revoked or postponed by the Directors wholly or in part as the Directors may determine. A call shall be deemed to have been made at the time when the resolution of the Directors authorising the call was passed. 10 Payment 35. Payment of a call may be made by instalments on the direction of the Directors. 36. If a sum called in respect of a Share is not paid before or on the day appointed for payment thereof, the person from whom the sum is due shall pay interest on the sum from the day payment is due to the time of the actual payment at such rate as the Directors may determine, but the Directors may waive payment of such interest wholly or in part. 37. Any sum payable in respect of a Share on issue or allotment or at any fixed date, whether in respect of the par value of the Share or premium or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a call and if it is not paid all the relevant provisions as to payment of interest, forfeiture or otherwise of these Articles shall apply as if such sum had become due and payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified. 38. The Directors may issue Shares with different terms as to the amount and times of payment of calls. Liability of joint holders 39. The joint holders of a Share shall be jointly and severally liable to pay calls in respect thereof. Interest 40. The Directors may, if they think fit, receive from any Member willing to advance the same, all or any part of the moneys uncalled and unpaid upon any Shares held by him; and may (until the amount would otherwise become payable) pay interest at such rate (not exceeding six per cent without the sanction of the Company in general meeting) as may be agreed upon between the Member paying the sum in advance and the Directors. FORFEITURE OF SHARES Notice 41. If a Member fails to pay any call or instalment of a call by the date it becomes due and payable, the Directors may, at any time thereafter while such call or instalment remains unpaid, give notice to the Member requiring payment of the unpaid portion of the call or instalment, together with any accrued interest and expenses incurred by the Company by reason of such non-payment. 11 42. The notice shall specify where and by what date (not being less than the Termination of 14 days’ from the date of the notice) payment is to be made and shall state that if it is not complied with the Shares in respect of which the call was made will be liable to be forfeited. The Directors may accept the surrTerminationer of any Share liable to be forfeited hereunder and, in such case, references to these Articles to forfeiture shall include surrTerminationer. Forfeiture for non-compliance 43. If such notice is not complied with, any Share in respect of which the notice was given may thereafter, before the payment of all calls or instalments and interest due in respect thereof has been made, be forfeited by a resolution of the Directors. Such forfeiture shall include all dividTerminations declared, other distributions or other monies payable in respect of the forfeited Shares and not paid before the forfeiture. Forfeited Shares 44. A forfeited Share may be sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed of upon such terms and in such manner as the Directors shall think fit, and at any time before a sale, re-allotment or disposition, the forfeiture may be cancelled on such terms as the Directors think fit. Continued liability for forfeited Member 45. A person whose Shares have been forfeited shall cease to be a Member in respect of the forfeited Shares, but shall remain liable to pay to the Company all moneys which at the date of forfeiture were presently payable by him in respect of the Shares together with interest at such rate as the Directors may determine from the date of forfeiture until payment, but his liability shall cease if and when the Company receives payment in full of all amounts due in respect of the Shares. The Company may enforce payment without being under any obligation to make any allowance for the value of the Shares forfeited. Evidence of forfeiture 46. An affidavit in writing by a Director or Secretary of the Company that a Share has been duly forfeited on a specified date, shall be conclusive evidence of the facts stated in it as against all persons claiming to be entitled to the Share. The Company may receive the consideration, if any, given for the Share on any sale, re-allotment or disposition thereof and may authorise some person to execute a Assignment of the Share in favour of the person to whom the Share is sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed of, and he shall thereupon be registered as the holder of the Share, and shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money (if any) nor shall his title to the Share be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings in reference to the forfeiture, sale, re-allotment or disposition of the Share. 12 47. The provisions of these Articles as to forfeiture shall apply in the case of non-payment of any sum which, by the terms of issue of a Share, becomes payable at a fixed time, whether on account of the par value of the Share, or by way of premium or otherwise, as if the same had been made payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified to the Member. INCREASE OF CAPITAL 48. The Company may from time to time by Ordinary Resolution increase its share capital by such sum, to be divided into new Shares of such par value, and with such rights, priorities and privileges attached thereto as the resolution shall prescribe. 49. Subject to any directions given by the Company in a general meeting, all new Shares shall be at the disposal of the Directors in accordance with these Articles. 50. The new Shares shall be subject to the same provisions of these Articles with reference to the payment of calls, lien, forfeiture, Assignment, transmission and otherwise, as the Shares in the original share capital. ALTERATION OF CAPITAL 51. The Company may from time to time by Ordinary Resolution: 51.1 consolidate and divide all or any of its share capital into Shares of larger par value than its existing Shares; 51.2 sub divide its existing Shares, or any of them, into Shares of smaller par value than is fixed by the Memorandum, subject nevertheless to the provisions of section 13 of the Law; 51.3 cancel any Shares which, at the date of the passing of the resolution, have not been taken or agreed to be taken by any person; and 51.4 convert all or any paid up Shares into stock, and reconvert all or any stock into paid up Shares of any denomination. 52. The Company may from time to time by Special Resolution: 52.1 divide its Shares into several classes and attach to such classes any preferential, deferred, or special rights or restrictions in accordance with these Articles; 52.2 change the currency denomination of its share capital; 13 52.3 reduce its share capital and any capital redemption reserve fund in any manner whatsoever; and 52.4 merge or consolidate with any one or more constituent companies (as defined in the Law). GENERAL MEETINGS Convening a meeting 53. The Directors may, whenever they think fit, convene an extraordinary general meeting. If at any time there are not sufficient Directors capable of acting to form a quorum, any Director, or any one or more Members holding in the aggregate not less than one third of the total issued share capital of the Company entitled to vote, may convene an extraordinary general meeting in the same manner as nearly as possible as that in which meetings may be convened by the Directors. Members’ requisition 54. The Directors shall, upon the requisition in writing of one or more Members holding in the aggregate not less than one tenth of such paid up capital of the Company as at the date of the requisition carries the right of voting at general meetings, convene an extraordinary general meeting. Any such requisition shall express the object of the meeting proposed to be called, and must be signed by the requisitionists and deposited at the Registered Office, and may consist of several documents in like form, each signed by one or more requisitionists. 55. If there are no Directors as at the date of the deposit of the Members’ requisition or if the Directors do not convene a general meeting within 21 days from the date of the deposit, the requisitionists or any or any of them or any other Member or Members holding in the aggregate not less than one tenth of such paid up capital of the Company as at the date of the requisition, may convene an extraordinary general meeting. A general meeting convened by requisitionists shall be convened in the same manner as nearly as possible as that in which general meetings are to be convened by the Directors. NOTICE OF GENERAL MEETINGS Length and form of notice 56. At least five clear days’ notice shall be given of any general meeting. Every notice shall specify the place, the day and the time of meeting and, in the case of special business, the general nature of the business to be conducted at the general meeting, and shall be given in the manner provided in these Articles or in such other manner (if any) as may be prescribed by the Company, to such persons as are entitled to receive such notices from the Company. A general meeting may be convened by such shorter notice, or without notice, by a majority in number of the Members having the right to attTermination and vote at the meeting, being a majority together holding not less than ninety-five percent in nominal value of the Shares giving that right. 14 Omission or non-receipt 57. The accidental omission to give notice of a meeting to, or the non-receipt of a notice of a meeting by, any Member entitled to receive notice shall not invalidate the proceedings at any meeting. PROCEEDINGS AT GENERAL MEETINGS 58. All business shall be deemed special that is transacted at an extraordinary general meeting. Quorum 59. No business shall be transacted at any general meeting unless a quorum of Members is present at the time that the meeting proceeds to business, but the absence of a quorum shall not preclude the appointment, choice or election of a chairman, which shall not be treated as part of the business of the Meeting. Save as herein otherwise provided, one or more Members holding in the aggregate not less than one third of the total issued share capital of the Company present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall be a quorum. Adjournment for lack of quorum 60. If within five minutes (or such longer time as the chairman of the meeting may determine to wait) after the time appointed for the meeting, a quorum is not present, the meeting, if convened upon the requisition of Members, shall be dissolved. In any other case, it shall stand adjourned to the same day in the next week, at the same time and place, and if at the adjourned meeting a quorum is not present within half an hour from the time appointed for the meeting, the Members present shall be a quorum. Meeting by telephone or other facilities 61. A meeting of the Members may be held by telephone, electronic or other communication facilities (including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, by telephone or video conferencing) by which all persons participating in the meeting can communicate with each other simultaneously and instantaneously, and participation in such a general meeting shall constitute presence in person at such meeting. 62. Any Director shall be entitled to attTermination and speak at any general meeting of the Company. 15 Appointment of chairman 63. The chairman (if any) of the Board of Directors shall preside as chairman at every general meeting of the Company. If there is no such chairman, or if at any meeting he is not present within five minutes after the time appointed for holding the meeting or is unwilling to act as chairman, the Directors present shall choose one of their number to act or, if only one Director is present, he shall preside as chairman if willing to act. If no Director is present, or if each of the Directors present declines to take the chair, the Members present and entitled to vote shall elect one of their number to be chairman. Adjournment of meeting 64. The chairman may, with the consent of a meeting at which a quorum is present (and shall if so directed by the meeting) adjourn the meeting from time to time and from place to place, but no business shall be transacted at any adjourned meeting other than the business left unfinished at the meeting from which the adjournment took place. When a meeting is adjourned for ten days or more, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given as in the case of an original meeting. Save as aforesaid, it shall not be necessary to give any notice of an adjournment or of the business to be transacted at an adjourned meeting. VOTING Ordinary Resolution Save where a Special Resolution or other greater majority is required by the Law or these Articles, any question proposed for consideration at any general meeting shall be decided by an Ordinary Resolution. Voting on a show of hands 65. At any general meeting, a resolution put to the vote of the meeting shall be decided on a show of hands, unless before or on the declaration of the result of the show of hands, or on the withdrawal of any other demand for a poll. Demand for poll 66. A poll is demanded by: 66.1 the chairman of the meeting; or 66.2 at least three Members present in person or by proxy; or 66.3 any Member or Members present in person or by proxy and holding collectively not less than one tenth of the total voting rights of all the Members having the right to vote at such meeting; or 16 66.4 a Member or Members present in person or by proxy holding Shares conferring the right to vote at such meeting, being Shares on which an aggregate sum has been paid up equal to not less than one tenth of the total sum paid up on all such Shares conferring such right. 67. Unless a poll is duly demanded and the demand is not withdrawn, a declaration by the chairman that a resolution has, on a show of hands, been carried or carried unanimously, or by a particular majority, or lost and an entry to that effect in the minutes of the proceedings of the Company shall be conclusive evidence of that fact, without proof of the number or proportion of the votes recorded in favour of, or against, that resolution. The demand for a poll may be withdrawn by the person or any persons making it at any time prior to the declaration of the result of the poll. 68. If a poll is duly demanded, it shall be taken in such manner as the chairman directs, and the result of the poll shall be deemed to be the resolution of the meeting at which the poll was demanded. 69. In the case of an equality of votes at a general meeting, whether on a show of hands or on a poll, the chairman of the meeting at which the show of hands takes place or at which the poll is demanded, shall not be entitled to a second or casting vote and the resolution shall fail. 70. A poll demanded on the election of a chairman or on a question of adjournment shall be taken forthwith. A poll demanded on any other question shall be taken in such manner and either forthwith or at such time later in the meeting as the chairman of the meeting shall direct. 71. The demand for a poll shall not prevent the continuance of a meeting for the transaction of any business other than the question on which the poll has been demanded and it may be withdrawn at any time before the close of the meeting or the taking of the poll, whichever is the earlier. Voting on a poll 72. On a poll votes may be cast either personally or by proxy. 73. A person entitled to more than one vote on a poll need not use all his votes or cast all the votes he uses in the same way. 74. On a show of hands, every Member present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall have one vote. On a poll, every Member present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall have one vote for each Share of which he is the registered holder. 17 75. In the case of joint holders of a Share, the vote of the senior who tTerminationers a vote, whether in person or by proxy, shall be accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint holders; and for this purpose seniority shall be determined by the order in which the names stand in the Register of Members in respect of the joint holding. 76. A Member of unsound mind, or, in respect of whom an order has been made by any court having jurisdiction in lunacy, may vote, whether on a show of hands or on a poll, by his receiver, committee, curator bonis or other person of similar nature appointed by such court, and any such receiver, committee, curator bonis or other person may vote by proxy and may otherwise act and be treated as such Member for the purpose of the general meetings. 77. No Member, unless the Directors otherwise determine, shall be entitled to vote at any general meeting, unless all calls or other sums presently payable by him in respect of Shares in the Company have been paid. 78. No objection shall be raised as to the qualification of any voter or as to whether any votes have been properly counted except at the general meeting or adjourned general meeting at which the vote objected to is given or tTerminationered and every vote not disallowed at the meeting shall be valid. Any objection made in due time and in accordance with these Articles shall be referred to the chairman whose decision shall be final and conclusive. Shareholder Restricted Matters 78A.

Such Secretary or other officers need not be Directors and in the case of the other officers may be ascribed such titles as the Directors may decide and the Directors may revoke or terminate any such election or appointment. Any such revocation or termination shall be without prejudice to any claim for any damages that such officer may have against the Company or the Company may have against such officer for any breach of any contract of service between him and the Company which may be involved in such revocation or termination.

DIVIDTerminationS Payment of DividTerminations 134. The Directors may from time to time declare dividTerminations to be paid to the Members according to their rights and interests, including such interim dividTerminations as appear to the Directors to be justified by the position of the Company. The Directors may also pay any fixed cash dividTermination which is payable on any Shares of the Company half yearly or on such other dates, whenever the position of the Company, in the opinion of the Directors, justifies such payment. 135. No dividTermination shall be paid otherwise than out of profits or out of monies otherwise available for dividTermination in accordance with the Law. Calculation of DividTerminations 136. Subject to the rights of Members, if any, entitled to Shares with special rights as to dividTerminations, all dividTerminations shall be declared and paid according to the amount paid up on the Shares in respect of which the dividTermination is paid and any dividTermination on any class of Shares not fully paid shall be declared and paid according to the amounts paid on the Shares of that class, but if and so long as nothing is paid up on any of the Shares in the Company, dividTerminations may be declared and paid according to the number of Shares. No amount paid on a Share in advance of calls shall, while carrying interest, be treated for the purposes of this Article as paid on the Share. DividTerminations may be apportioned and paid pro rata according to the amounts paid-up on the Shares during any portion or portions of the period in respect of which the dividTermination is paid. 31 Deductions 137. The Directors may deduct from any dividTermination, distribution or other monies payable to a Member by the Company on or in respect of any Shares all sums of money (if any) presently payable by him to the Company on account of calls or otherwise in respect of Shares of the Company. Joint Holders 138. If several persons are registered as joint holders of any Share, any of them may give effectual receipts for any dividTermination or other money payable on or in respect of the Share. Payment method 139. Any dividTermination may be paid by cheque or warrant sent through the post to the address of the Member or person entitled thereto in the Register of Members or, in the case of joint holders addressed to the holder whose name stands first in the Register of Members in respect of the Shares at his registered address as appearing on the Register of Members or to such person and such address as the Member or person entitled or such joint holders as the case may be may direct in writing. Every such cheque or warrant shall, unless the holder or joint holders may in writing direct, be made payable to the order of the person to whom it is sent or to the order of the holder or, in the case of joint holders, to the order of the holder whose name stands first in the Register of Members in respect of such Shares, and shall be sent at his or their risk and payment of the cheque or warrant by the bank on which it is drawn shall constitute a good discharge to the Company. Any one of two or more joint holders may give effectual receipts for any dividTerminations, distributions or other monies payable or property distributable in respect of the Shares held by such joint holders. Satisfaction by distribution of specific assets 140. The Directors may declare that any dividTermination or distribution is paid wholly or partly by the distribution of specific assets and, in particular, of paid up shares, debentures or debenture stock of any other company or in any one or more of such ways, and where any difficulty arises in regard to such dividTermination or distribution, the Directors may settle the same as they think expedient, and in particular may issue fractional Shares or ignore fractions altogether and may fix the value for dividTermination or distribution of such specific assets or any part thereof and may determine that cash payments shall be made to any Members upon the basis of the value so fixed in order to secure equality of distribution, and may vest any such specific assets in trustees as may seem expedient to the Directors. 32 No interest 141. No dividTermination or other distribution or other monies payable by the Company on or in respect of any Share shall bear interest against the Company. Unclaimed dividTerminations 142. All unclaimed dividTerminations or distributions may be invested or otherwise made use of by the Directors for the benefit of the Company until claimed. Any dividTermination or distribution unclaimed by a Member six years after the dividTermination or distribution payment date shall be forfeited and revert to the Company. RESERVES 143. The Directors may, before declaring any dividTermination or distribution, set aside such sums as they think proper as a reserve or reserves which shall, at the discretion of the Directors, be applicable for meeting contingencies, or for equalising dividTerminations, or for any other purpose of the Company, and pTerminationing such application may, in their discretion, be employed in the business of the Company or be invested in such manner as the Directors may from time to time think fit. The Directors may also without placing the same to reserve carry forward any sums which they think it prudent not to distribute. CAPITALISATION OF PROFITS Capitalisation 144. The Directors may capitalise any sum standing to the credit of any of the Company’s reserve accounts which are available for distribution (including its Share Premium Account and capital redemption reserve fund, subject to the Law) or any sum standing to the credit of the profit and loss account or otherwise available for distribution and to appropriate such sums to Members in the proportions in which such sum would have been divisible amongst them had the same been a distribution of profits by way of dividTermination and to apply such sum on their behalf in paying up in full unissued Shares for allotment and distribution credited as fully paid-up to and amongst them in the proportion aforesaid. Authorisation 145. Where any difficulty arises in regard to any distribution under the last preceding Article, the Directors may settle the same as they think expedient and, in particular, may authorise any person to sell and Assignment any fractions or may resolve that the distribution should be as nearly as may be practicable in the correct proportion but not exactly so or may ignore fractions altogether, and may determine that cash payments should be made to any Members in order to adjust the rights of all parties, as may seem expedient to the Directors. The Directors may appoint any person to sign on behalf of the persons entitled to participate in the distribution any contract necessary or desirable for giving effect thereto and such appointment shall be effective and binding upon the Members. 33 SHARE PREMIUM ACCOUNT 146. The Directors shall in accordance with the Law establish a Share Premium Account and shall carry to the credit of such account from time to time a sum equal to the amount or value of the premium paid on the issue of any Share. 147. There shall be debited to any Share Premium Account on the redemption or purchase of a Share the difference between the nominal value of such Share and the redemption or purchase price provided always that at the discretion of the Directors such sum may be paid out of the profits of the Company or, if permitted by the Law, out of capital.

Inspection by Members 149. The accounting records shall be kept at the Registered Office or at such other place or places as the Directors think fit, and shall at all times be open to inspection by the Directors.

A notice may be given by the Company to the person entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a Member by sTerminationing it through the post in a prepaid letter addressed to them by name, or by the title of representatives of the deceased, or trustee of the bankrupt, or by any like description, at the address, if any, supplied for the purpose by the persons claiming to be so entitled, or (until such an address has been so supplied) by giving the notice in any manner in which the same might have been given if the death or bankruptcy had not occurred. 154.

No other persons shall be entitled to receive notices of general meeting. 35 WINDING UP Method of winding up 156. Subject to the rights attaching to any Shares, if the Company shall be wound up, the liquidator may, with the sanction of a Special Resolution and any other sanction required by the Law or these Articles, divide amongst the Members in kind the whole or any part of the assets of the Company (whether they shall consist of property of the same kind or not) and may for such purpose set such value as he deems fair upon any property to be divided as aforesaid and may determine how such division shall be carried out as between the Members or different classes of Members. The liquidator may, with the like sanction, vest the whole or any part of such assets in trustees upon such trusts for the benefit of the contributories as the liquidator, with the like sanction, shall think fit, but so that no Member shall be compelled to accept any asset upon which there is any liability. Distribution of assets 157. If the Company shall be wound up and the assets available for distribution amongst the Members as such shall be insufficient to repay the whole of the paid up capital, such assets shall be distributed so that, as nearly as may be, the losses shall be borne by the Members in proportion to the capital paid up, or which ought to have been paid up, at the commencement of the winding up, on the Shares held by them respectively. And if in a winding up the assets available for distribution amongst the Members shall be more than sufficient to repay the whole of the capital paid up at the commencement of the winding up, the excess shall be distributed amongst the Members in proportion to the capital paid up at the commencement of the winding up on the Shares held by them respectively. This Article is to be without prejudice to the rights of the holders of Shares issued upon special terms and conditions. Indemnification Indemnification and limitation of liability 158. Every Indemnified Person shall, in the absence of wilful neglect or default, be indemnified and held harmless out of the assets of the Company against all liabilities, loss, damage, cost or expense (including but not limited to liabilities under contract, tort and statute or any applicable foreign law or regulation and all reasonable legal and other costs and expenses on a full Indemnification basis properly payable) incurred or suffered by him by or by reason of any act done, conceived in or omitted in the conduct of the Company’s business or in the discharge of his duties and the Indemnification contained in this Article shall extTermination to any Indemnified Person acting in any office or trust in the reasonable belief that he has been appointed or elected to such office or trust notwithstanding any defect in such appointment or election. 36 159. No Indemnified Person shall be liable to the Company for acts, defaults or omissions of any other Indemnified Person. Indemnification and reimbursement 160. Every Indemnified Person shall be indemnified out of the funds of the Company against all liabilities incurred by him by or by reason of any act done, conceived in or omitted in the conduct of the Company’s business or in the discharge of his duties in defTerminationing any proceedings, whether civil or criminal, in which judgment is given in his favour, or in which he is acquitted, or in connection with any application in which relief from liability is granted to him by the court. 161. To the extent that any Indemnified Person is entitled to claim an Indemnification pursuant to these Articles in respect of amounts paid or discharged by him, the relative Indemnification shall take effect as an obligation of the Company to reimburse the person making such payment or effecting such discharge. Wilful neglect or default 162. Each Member and the Company agree to waive any claim or right of action he or it may at any time have, whether individually or by or in the right of the Company, against any Indemnified Person on account of any act or omission of such Indemnified Person in the performance of his duties for the Company; provided however, that such waiver shall not apply to any claims or rights of action arising out of the wilful neglect or default of such Indemnified Person or to recover any gain, personal profit or advantage to which such Indemnified Person is not legally entitled. Advance of legal fees 163. Expenses incurred in defTerminationing any civil or criminal action or proceeding for which indemnification is required pursuant to these Articles shall be paid by the Company in advance of the final disposition of such action or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnified Person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that the Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified pursuant to these Articles. Each Member of the Company shall be deemed to have acknowledged and agreed that the advances of funds may be made by the Company as aforesaid, and when made by the Company under this Article are made to meet expTerminationitures incurred for the purpose of enabling such Indemnified Person to properly perform his or her duties to the Company. 37 CONTINUATION 164. The Company shall have the power, subject to the provisions of the Law and with the approval of a Special Resolution, to continue as a body incorporated under the laws of any jurisdiction outside of the Cayman Islands and to be de-registered in the Cayman Islands. AMTerminationMENT OF MEMORANDUM AND ARTICLES Subject to the provisions of the Law, the Company may from time to time by Special Resolution alter or amTermination the Memorandum or these Articles in whole or in part provided that no such amTerminationment shall affect the special rights attaching to any class of Shares without the consent or sanction provided for in these Articles.

Notwithstanding the preceding Article, the Subscriber shall have the power to: 6.1 issue one Share to itself; 6.2 Assignment that Share by an instrument of Assignment to any person; and 6.3 update the Register of Members in respect of the issue and Assignment of that Share. No Shares to bearer 7. The Company shall not issue Shares to bearer. Fractional Shares 8. The Company may, in accordance with the Law, issue fractions of Shares. REGISTER OF MEMBERS 9. The Directors shall establish and maintain (or cause to be established and maintained) the Register of Members at the Registered Office or at such other place determined by the Directors in the manner prescribed by the Law. 5 RECORD DATE Power of Directors to fix record date 10. The Directors may fix in advance a date as the record date to determine the Members entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of the Members and, for the purpose of determining the Members entitled to receive payment of any dividTermination, the Directors may, at or within 90 days prior to the date of the declaration of such dividTermination, fix a subsequent date as the record date for such determination. No fixed record date 11. If no such record date is fixed, the record date shall be the date on which notice of the meeting is sent or the date on which the resolution of the Directors declaring such dividTermination is adopted, as the case may be. A determination of Members entitled to vote at any meeting of Members in accordance with this Article, shall apply to any adjournment thereof. SHARE CERTIFICATES Issue of Share Certificates 12. Every Member shall be entitled, without payment, to a certificate of the Company specifying the Share or Shares held by him and the amount paid up thereon. 13. Notwithstanding the provisions of these Articles, the Directors may resolve not to issue share certificates to Members of the Company. Certificates for jointly-held Shares 14. The Company shall not be bound to issue more than one certificate for Shares held jointly by more than one person, and delivery of a certificate to one joint holder shall be sufficient delivery to all. Replacement Share Certificates 15. If a share certificate is defaced, lost or destroyed, it may be replaced on payment of such fee (if any) and on such terms (if any) as to evidence and Indemnification, and on the payment of expenses of the Company in investigating such evidence and preparing such Indemnification as the Directors shall think fit and, in case of defacement, on delivery of the old certificate to the Company for cancellation. 6 Assignment OF SHARES Instrument of Assignment 16. The instrument of Assignment of any Share shall be executed by or on behalf of the Assignmentor (and, if the Directors so determine, the Assignmentee). The Assignmentor shall be deemed to remain the holder of the Share until the name of the Assignmentee is entered in the Register of Members in respect of such Share. All instruments of Assignment, once registered, may be retained by the Company. 17. Subject to any applicable restrictions contained in these Articles, Shares shall be Assignmentred in any usual or common form approved by the Directors. Refusal to register Assignments 18. The Directors may, in their absolute discretion and without assigning any reason therefore, decline to register any Assignment of any Share. The Directors may require reasonable evidence to show the right of the Assignmentor to make the Assignment. 19. If the Directors decline to register a Assignment of Shares they shall sTermination notice of the refusal to the Assignmentee within one month after the date on which the Assignment was lodged with the Company. 20. The Directors may also suspTermination the registration of the Assignments at such times and for such periods as the Directors may from time to time determine. TRANSMISSION OF SHARES Transmission of Shares 21. If a Member dies, the survivor or survivors (where he was a joint holder), and the legal personal representative (where he was sole holder), shall be the only person recognised by the Company as having any title to the Share. The estate of a deceased Member is not thereby released from any liability in respect of any Share held by him, whether solely or jointly. For the purpose of this Article, legal personal representative means the person to whom probate or letters of administration has or have been granted in the Cayman Islands or, if there is no such person, such other person as the Directors may in their absolute discretion determine to be the person recognised by the Company for the purpose of this Article. Election by persons entitled on transmission 22. Any person becoming entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a Member or otherwise by operation of Governing Law may elect, upon such evidence being produced as may be required by the Directors as to his entitlement, either be registered himself as a Member in respect of the Share or, instead of being registered himself, to make such Assignment of the Share as the deceased or bankrupt Member could have made. 7 Manner of election 23. If the person so becoming entitled elects to be registered himself, he shall deliver or sTermination to the Company a notice in writing signed by him stating that he so elects. If he shall elect to Assignment the Shares, he shall signify his election by signing an instrument of Assignment of such Shares in favour of his Assignmentee. All the limitations, restrictions and provisions of these Articles relating to the right to Assignment and the registration of Assignments of Shares shall be applicable to any such notice or instrument of Assignment as aforesaid as if the death of the Member or other event giving rise to the transmission had not occurred and the notice or instrument of Assignment was an instrument of Assignment signed by such Member. Rights of persons entitled on transmission 24. A person becoming entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of the Member (or otherwise by operation of Governing Law), upon such evidence being produced as may be required by the Directors as to his entitlement, shall be entitled to the same dividTerminations and other monies payable in respect of the Share as he would be entitled if he were the holder of such Share. However, he shall not be entitled, until he becomes registered as the holder of such Share, to receive notices of or to attTermination or vote at general meetings of the Company or (except as aforesaid) to exercise any other rights or privileges of a Member. The Directors may at any time give notice requiring such person to elect either to be registered himself or to Assignment the Share and, if the notice is not complied with within sixty days, the Directors may thereafter withhold payment of all dividTerminations and other monies payable in respect of the Shares until the requirements of the notice have been complied with. REDEMPTION AND PURCHASE OF SHARES 25. Subject to the provisions of the Law and the Memorandum, the Company may: 25.1 purchase its own Shares (including any redeemable Shares) in such manner and on such terms as the Directors may agree with the relevant Member unless following such purchase there would no longer be any issued Shares and may make payment for such purchase or for any redemption of Shares in any manner authorised by the Law, including out of capital; and 25.2 reduce its share capital and any capital redemption reserve fund in any manner whatsoever. 8 VARIATION OF SHARE RIGHTS Variation of class rights 26. If at any time the share capital is divided into different classes of Shares, all or any of the special rights attached to any class of Shares (unless otherwise provided by the terms of issue of the Shares of that class) may be varied or abrogated with the consent in writing of the holders of not less than two thirds of the issued Shares of that class or with the sanction of a resolution passed by the holders of not less than two thirds of the issued Shares of that class as may be present in person or by proxy at a separate general meeting of the holders of the Shares of that class. To any such separate general meeting, all of the provisions of these Articles relating to general meetings shall mutatis mutandis apply, but so that the necessary quorum shall be any one or more persons holding or representing by proxy not less than one third of the issued Shares of the class and that any holder of Shares of the relevant class present in person or by proxy may demand a poll. Treatment of classes 27. For the purpose of a separate class meeting, the Directors may treat two or more of all classes of Shares as forming one class if they consider that such class of Shares would be affected in the same way by the proposals under consideration. Effect of Share issue on class rights 28. The rights conferred upon the holders of any Shares shall not, unless otherwise expressly provided in the rights attaching to such Shares, be deemed to be altered by the creation or issue of further Shares ranking pari passu therewith. NON-RECOGNITION OF TRUSTS 29. Except as required by the Law or these Articles, or under an order of a court of competent jurisdiction, the Company shall not be bound by or compelled to recognise in any way, even when notice thereof is given to it, any equitable, contingent, future or partial interest in any Share, or any other rights in respect of any Share other than an absolute right to the entirety thereof in the registered holder. 9 LIEN Lien generally 30. The Company shall have a first and paramount lien on every Share (not being a fully paid Share) for all moneys (whether presently payable or not) called or payable at a date fixed by or in accordance with the terms of issue of such Share in respect of that Share, and the Company shall also have a first and paramount lien on every Share (other than a fully paid up Share) standing registered in the name of a Member, whether singly or jointly with any other person for all debts and liabilities of a Member or his estate to the Company, whether the same shall have been incurred before or after notice to the Company of any interest of any person other than such Member, and whether the time for the payment or discharge of the same shall have actually arrived or not, and notwithstanding that the same are joint debts or liabilities of such Member or his estate and any other person, whether a Member or not. The Directors may at any time, either generally or in any particular case, waive any lien that has arisen or declare any Share to be wholly or in part exempt from the provisions of this Article. The Company's lien, if any, on a Share shall extTermination to all dividTerminations payable thereon. Enforcement 31. The Company may sell, in such manner as the Directors think fit, any Share on which the Company has a lien, provided a sum in respect of which the lien exists is presently payable, and is not paid within fourteen days after a notice in writing has been given to the registered holder  for the time being of the Share, demanding payment of the sum presently payable and giving notice of the intention to sell in default of such payment. Completion of sale 32. For giving effect to any such sale, the Directors may authorise any person to Assignment the Share sold to the purchaser thereof. The purchaser shall be registered as the holder of the Share comprised in any such Assignment and he shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money, nor shall his title to the Share be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings relating to the sale. Application of proceeds 33. The net proceeds of such sale shall be applied in payment or discharge of the debt or liability in respect of which the lien exists and as is presently payable, and any balance shall (subject to a like lien for debts or liabilities not presently payable as existed upon the Shares prior to the sale) be paid to the person who was the registered holder of the Share immediately before such sale. CALLS ON SHARES Calls on Shares generally 34. The Directors may from time to time make calls upon the Members in respect of any moneys unpaid on their Shares (whether in respect of the par value of the Shares or premium or otherwise and not, by the terms of issue thereof, made payable at a future date fixed by or in accordance with such terms of issue); and each Member shall (subject to the Company serving upon him at least 14 days’ notice specifying the time or times and place of payment) pay to the Company at the time or times and place so specified the amount called on his Shares. A call may be revoked or postponed by the Directors wholly or in part as the Directors may determine. A call shall be deemed to have been made at the time when the resolution of the Directors authorising the call was passed. 10 Payment 35. Payment of a call may be made by instalments on the direction of the Directors. 36. If a sum called in respect of a Share is not paid before or on the day appointed for payment thereof, the person from whom the sum is due shall pay interest on the sum from the day payment is due to the time of the actual payment at such rate as the Directors may determine, but the Directors may waive payment of such interest wholly or in part. 37. Any sum payable in respect of a Share on issue or allotment or at any fixed date, whether in respect of the par value of the Share or premium or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a call and if it is not paid all the relevant provisions as to payment of interest, forfeiture or otherwise of these Articles shall apply as if such sum had become due and payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified. 38. The Directors may issue Shares with different terms as to the amount and times of payment of calls. Liability of joint holders 39. The joint holders of a Share shall be jointly and severally liable to pay calls in respect thereof. Interest 40. The Directors may, if they think fit, receive from any Member willing to advance the same, all or any part of the moneys uncalled and unpaid upon any Shares held by him; and may (until the amount would otherwise become payable) pay interest at such rate (not exceeding six per cent without the sanction of the Company in general meeting) as may be agreed upon between the Member paying the sum in advance and the Directors. FORFEITURE OF SHARES Notice 41. If a Member fails to pay any call or instalment of a call by the date it becomes due and payable, the Directors may, at any time thereafter while such call or instalment remains unpaid, give notice to the Member requiring payment of the unpaid portion of the call or instalment, together with any accrued interest and expenses incurred by the Company by reason of such non-payment. 11 42. The notice shall specify where and by what date (not being less than the Termination of 14 days’ from the date of the notice) payment is to be made and shall state that if it is not complied with the Shares in respect of which the call was made will be liable to be forfeited. The Directors may accept the surrTerminationer of any Share liable to be forfeited hereunder and, in such case, references to these Articles to forfeiture shall include surrTerminationer. Forfeiture for non-compliance 43. If such notice is not complied with, any Share in respect of which the notice was given may thereafter, before the payment of all calls or instalments and interest due in respect thereof has been made, be forfeited by a resolution of the Directors. Such forfeiture shall include all dividTerminations declared, other distributions or other monies payable in respect of the forfeited Shares and not paid before the forfeiture. Forfeited Shares 44. A forfeited Share may be sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed of upon such terms and in such manner as the Directors shall think fit, and at any time before a sale, re-allotment or disposition, the forfeiture may be cancelled on such terms as the Directors think fit. Continued liability for forfeited Member 45. A person whose Shares have been forfeited shall cease to be a Member in respect of the forfeited Shares, but shall remain liable to pay to the Company all moneys which at the date of forfeiture were presently payable by him in respect of the Shares together with interest at such rate as the Directors may determine from the date of forfeiture until payment, but his liability shall cease if and when the Company receives payment in full of all amounts due in respect of the Shares. The Company may enforce payment without being under any obligation to make any allowance for the value of the Shares forfeited. Evidence of forfeiture 46. An affidavit in writing by a Director or Secretary of the Company that a Share has been duly forfeited on a specified date, shall be conclusive evidence of the facts stated in it as against all persons claiming to be entitled to the Share. The Company may receive the consideration, if any, given for the Share on any sale, re-allotment or disposition thereof and may authorise some person to execute a Assignment of the Share in favour of the person to whom the Share is sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed of, and he shall thereupon be registered as the holder of the Share, and shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money (if any) nor shall his title to the Share be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings in reference to the forfeiture, sale, re-allotment or disposition of the Share. 12 47. The provisions of these Articles as to forfeiture shall apply in the case of non-payment of any sum which, by the terms of issue of a Share, becomes payable at a fixed time, whether on account of the par value of the Share, or by way of premium or otherwise, as if the same had been made payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified to the Member. INCREASE OF CAPITAL 48. The Company may from time to time by Ordinary Resolution increase its share capital by such sum, to be divided into new Shares of such par value, and with such rights, priorities and privileges attached thereto as the resolution shall prescribe. 49. Subject to any directions given by the Company in a general meeting, all new Shares shall be at the disposal of the Directors in accordance with these Articles. 50. The new Shares shall be subject to the same provisions of these Articles with reference to the payment of calls, lien, forfeiture, Assignment, transmission and otherwise, as the Shares in the original share capital. ALTERATION OF CAPITAL 51. The Company may from time to time by Ordinary Resolution: 51.1 consolidate and divide all or any of its share capital into Shares of larger par value than its existing Shares; 51.2 sub divide its existing Shares, or any of them, into Shares of smaller par value than is fixed by the Memorandum, subject nevertheless to the provisions of section 13 of the Law; 51.3 cancel any Shares which, at the date of the passing of the resolution, have not been taken or agreed to be taken by any person; and 51.4 convert all or any paid up Shares into stock, and reconvert all or any stock into paid up Shares of any denomination. 52. The Company may from time to time by Special Resolution: 52.1 divide its Shares into several classes and attach to such classes any preferential, deferred, or special rights or restrictions in accordance with these Articles; 52.2 change the currency denomination of its share capital; 13 52.3 reduce its share capital and any capital redemption reserve fund in any manner whatsoever; and 52.4 merge or consolidate with any one or more constituent companies (as defined in the Law). GENERAL MEETINGS Convening a meeting 53. The Directors may, whenever they think fit, convene an extraordinary general meeting. If at any time there are not sufficient Directors capable of acting to form a quorum, any Director, or any one or more Members holding in the aggregate not less than one third of the total issued share capital of the Company entitled to vote, may convene an extraordinary general meeting in the same manner as nearly as possible as that in which meetings may be convened by the Directors. Members’ requisition 54. The Directors shall, upon the requisition in writing of one or more Members holding in the aggregate not less than one tenth of such paid up capital of the Company as at the date of the requisition carries the right of voting at general meetings, convene an extraordinary general meeting. Any such requisition shall express the object of the meeting proposed to be called, and must be signed by the requisitionists and deposited at the Registered Office, and may consist of several documents in like form, each signed by one or more requisitionists. 55. If there are no Directors as at the date of the deposit of the Members’ requisition or if the Directors do not convene a general meeting within 21 days from the date of the deposit, the requisitionists or any or any of them or any other Member or Members holding in the aggregate not less than one tenth of such paid up capital of the Company as at the date of the requisition, may convene an extraordinary general meeting. A general meeting convened by requisitionists shall be convened in the same manner as nearly as possible as that in which general meetings are to be convened by the Directors. NOTICE OF GENERAL MEETINGS Length and form of notice 56. At least five clear days’ notice shall be given of any general meeting. Every notice shall specify the place, the day and the time of meeting and, in the case of special business, the general nature of the business to be conducted at the general meeting, and shall be given in the manner provided in these Articles or in such other manner (if any) as may be prescribed by the Company, to such persons as are entitled to receive such notices from the Company. A general meeting may be convened by such shorter notice, or without notice, by a majority in number of the Members having the right to attTermination and vote at the meeting, being a majority together holding not less than ninety-five percent in nominal value of the Shares giving that right. 14 Omission or non-receipt 57. The accidental omission to give notice of a meeting to, or the non-receipt of a notice of a meeting by, any Member entitled to receive notice shall not invalidate the proceedings at any meeting. PROCEEDINGS AT GENERAL MEETINGS 58. All business shall be deemed special that is transacted at an extraordinary general meeting. Quorum 59. No business shall be transacted at any general meeting unless a quorum of Members is present at the time that the meeting proceeds to business, but the absence of a quorum shall not preclude the appointment, choice or election of a chairman, which shall not be treated as part of the business of the Meeting. Save as herein otherwise provided, one or more Members holding in the aggregate not less than one third of the total issued share capital of the Company present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall be a quorum. Adjournment for lack of quorum 60. If within five minutes (or such longer time as the chairman of the meeting may determine to wait) after the time appointed for the meeting, a quorum is not present, the meeting, if convened upon the requisition of Members, shall be dissolved. In any other case, it shall stand adjourned to the same day in the next week, at the same time and place, and if at the adjourned meeting a quorum is not present within half an hour from the time appointed for the meeting, the Members present shall be a quorum. Meeting by telephone or other facilities 61. A meeting of the Members may be held by telephone, electronic or other communication facilities (including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, by telephone or video conferencing) by which all persons participating in the meeting can communicate with each other simultaneously and instantaneously, and participation in such a general meeting shall constitute presence in person at such meeting. 62. Any Director shall be entitled to attTermination and speak at any general meeting of the Company. 15 Appointment of chairman 63. The chairman (if any) of the Board of Directors shall preside as chairman at every general meeting of the Company. If there is no such chairman, or if at any meeting he is not present within five minutes after the time appointed for holding the meeting or is unwilling to act as chairman, the Directors present shall choose one of their number to act or, if only one Director is present, he shall preside as chairman if willing to act. If no Director is present, or if each of the Directors present declines to take the chair, the Members present and entitled to vote shall elect one of their number to be chairman. Adjournment of meeting 64. The chairman may, with the consent of a meeting at which a quorum is present (and shall if so directed by the meeting) adjourn the meeting from time to time and from place to place, but no business shall be transacted at any adjourned meeting other than the business left unfinished at the meeting from which the adjournment took place. When a meeting is adjourned for ten days or more, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given as in the case of an original meeting. Save as aforesaid, it shall not be necessary to give any notice of an adjournment or of the business to be transacted at an adjourned meeting. VOTING Ordinary Resolution Save where a Special Resolution or other greater majority is required by the Law or these Articles, any question proposed for consideration at any general meeting shall be decided by an Ordinary Resolution. Voting on a show of hands 65. At any general meeting, a resolution put to the vote of the meeting shall be decided on a show of hands, unless before or on the declaration of the result of the show of hands, or on the withdrawal of any other demand for a poll. Demand for poll 66. A poll is demanded by: 66.1 the chairman of the meeting; or 66.2 at least three Members present in person or by proxy; or 66.3 any Member or Members present in person or by proxy and holding collectively not less than one tenth of the total voting rights of all the Members having the right to vote at such meeting; or 16 66.4 a Member or Members present in person or by proxy holding Shares conferring the right to vote at such meeting, being Shares on which an aggregate sum has been paid up equal to not less than one tenth of the total sum paid up on all such Shares conferring such right. 67. Unless a poll is duly demanded and the demand is not withdrawn, a declaration by the chairman that a resolution has, on a show of hands, been carried or carried unanimously, or by a particular majority, or lost and an entry to that effect in the minutes of the proceedings of the Company shall be conclusive evidence of that fact, without proof of the number or proportion of the votes recorded in favour of, or against, that resolution. The demand for a poll may be withdrawn by the person or any persons making it at any time prior to the declaration of the result of the poll. 68. If a poll is duly demanded, it shall be taken in such manner as the chairman directs, and the result of the poll shall be deemed to be the resolution of the meeting at which the poll was demanded. 69. In the case of an equality of votes at a general meeting, whether on a show of hands or on a poll, the chairman of the meeting at which the show of hands takes place or at which the poll is demanded, shall not be entitled to a second or casting vote and the resolution shall fail. 70. A poll demanded on the election of a chairman or on a question of adjournment shall be taken forthwith. A poll demanded on any other question shall be taken in such manner and either forthwith or at such time later in the meeting as the chairman of the meeting shall direct. 71. The demand for a poll shall not prevent the continuance of a meeting for the transaction of any business other than the question on which the poll has been demanded and it may be withdrawn at any time before the close of the meeting or the taking of the poll, whichever is the earlier. Voting on a poll 72. On a poll votes may be cast either personally or by proxy. 73. A person entitled to more than one vote on a poll need not use all his votes or cast all the votes he uses in the same way. 74. On a show of hands, every Member present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall have one vote. On a poll, every Member present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall have one vote for each Share of which he is the registered holder. 17 75. In the case of joint holders of a Share, the vote of the senior who tTerminationers a vote, whether in person or by proxy, shall be accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint holders; and for this purpose seniority shall be determined by the order in which the names stand in the Register of Members in respect of the joint holding. 76. A Member of unsound mind, or, in respect of whom an order has been made by any court having jurisdiction in lunacy, may vote, whether on a show of hands or on a poll, by his receiver, committee, curator bonis or other person of similar nature appointed by such court, and any such receiver, committee, curator bonis or other person may vote by proxy and may otherwise act and be treated as such Member for the purpose of the general meetings. 77. No Member, unless the Directors otherwise determine, shall be entitled to vote at any general meeting, unless all calls or other sums presently payable by him in respect of Shares in the Company have been paid. 78. No objection shall be raised as to the qualification of any voter or as to whether any votes have been properly counted except at the general meeting or adjourned general meeting at which the vote objected to is given or tTerminationered and every vote not disallowed at the meeting shall be valid. Any objection made in due time and in accordance with these Articles shall be referred to the chairman whose decision shall be final and conclusive. Shareholder Restricted Matters 78A. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Memorandum or in these Articles or in the Law, for so long as HLNG is a Member, the Company shall not consent to or approve, and shall not permit any of Höegh LNG Colombia S.A.S. or Höegh LNG FSRU IV to consent to or approve, any of the following actions without the prior written consent of HLNG: 78A.1 any merger or consolidation involving any of the Company, Höegh LNG Colombia S.A.S. or Höegh LNG FSRU IV, or any of their respective subsidiaries; or 78A.2 any sale, exchange or Assignment of all or substantially all of the assets of any of the Company, Höegh LNG Colombia S.A.S. or Höegh LNG FSRU IV, or any of their respective subsidiaries; 78A.3 dissolution or liquidation of any of the Company, Höegh LNG Colombia S.A.S. or Höegh LNG FSRU IVor any of their respective subsidiaries; or 78A.4 creating or causing to exist any consensual restriction on the ability of any of the Company, Höegh LNG Colombia S.A.S. or Höegh LNG FSRU IV, or any of their respective subsidiaries, to make distributions, pay any indebtedness, make loans or advanes or Assignment assets to their respective owners, members or shareholders, or their respective subsidiaries; or 18 78A.5 settling or compromising any claim, dispute or Dispute Resolution directly against, or otherwise relating to indemnification by any of the Company, Höegh LNG Colombia S.A.S. or Höegh LNG FSRU IV, or any of their respective subsidiaries, of any of the directors or officers of HMLP, Höegh LNG Holdings Ltd. or HLNG, or their respective subsidiaries; or 78A.6 issuing any additional ownership interests in any of the Company, Höegh LNG Colombia S.A.S. or Höegh LNG FSRU IV[, or any of their respective subsidiaries]; or 78A.7 amTerminationing, supplementing or otherwise modifying, in whole or in part, the Memorandum or these Articles. PROXIES AND CORPORATE REPRESENTATIVES Members’ attTerminationance and voting 79. Subject to these Articles, each Member entitled to attTermination and vote at a general meeting may attTermination and vote at the general meeting: 79.1 in person, or where a Member is a company or non-natural person, by a duly authorised corporate representative; or 79.2 by one or more proxies. 80. A proxy or corporate representative need not be a Member. Appointment of proxies 81.

Form of proxy 82. An instrument appointing a proxy may be in any usual or common form (or such other form as the Directors may approve) and may be expressed to be for a particular meeting or any adjournment thereof or may appoint a standing proxy until notice of revocation is received at the Registered Office or at such place or places as the Directors may otherwise specify for the purpose. 19 Corporate representatives 83. Any corporation which is a Member of the Company may by resolution of its directors or other governing body authorise such person as it thinks fit to act as its representative at any meeting of the Company or of any class of Members of the Company, and the person so authorised shall be entitled to exercise the same powers on behalf of the corporation which he represents as that corporation could exercise if it were an individual Member of the Company. Receipt of instrument of appointment 84. The instrument appointing a proxy or corporate representative, and the power of attorney (if any) under which it is signed, together with such other evidence as to its due execution as the Directors may from time to time require, shall be deposited at the Registered Office of the Company or at such other place as is specified for that purpose in the notice convening the meeting or in any notice of any adjournment or, in either case or the case of a written resolution, in any document sent therewith, not less than 24 hours (or such longer or shorter time as the Directors may determine) before the time for holding the meeting or adjourned meeting at which the person named in the instrument proposes to vote. 85. In default of any of the provisions in these Articles to deposit any instrument of proxy or authorisation at the Registered Office of the Company or at such other place as is specified for that purpose in the notice convening the meeting, the instrument of proxy or authorisation shall not be treated as valid provided that the chairman of the meeting may in his discretion accept an instrument of proxy or authorisation sent by email or fax upon receipt of email or fax confirmation that the signed original thereof has been sent. 20 Standing Proxy 86. The operation of a standing proxy or authorisation shall be suspTerminationed at any general meeting or adjournment thereof at which the Member is present in person or by specially appointed proxy. The Directors may require evidence as to the due execution and continuing validity of any standing proxy or authorisation and the operation of any such standing proxy or authorisation shall be deemed to be suspTerminationed until the Directors determine that they have received such satisfactory evidence. Poll vote 87. In the case of a poll taken subsequently to the date of a meeting or adjourned meeting, the instrument appointing the proxy or corporate representative referred to in these Articles shall be deposited at the Registered Office of the Company or at such other place as is specified for that purpose in the notice convening the meeting before the time appointed for the taking of the poll. 88. The instrument appointing a proxy shall be deemed to confer authority to demand or join in demanding a poll, to speak at the meeting and to vote on any amTerminationment of a written resolution or amTerminationment of a resolution put to the meeting for which it is given as the proxy thinks fit. The instrument of proxy or authorisation shall, unless the contrary is stated therein, be valid as well for any adjournment of the meeting as for the meeting to which it relates. Validity of votes 89. A vote given in accordance with the terms of an instrument of proxy or authorisation shall be valid notwithstanding the previous death or unsoundness of mind of the principal, or revocation of the proxy or of the corporate authority, unless notice in writing of such death, unsoundness of mind or revocation was received by the Company at the Registered Office (or such other place as may be specified for the delivery of instruments of proxy or authorisation in the notice convening the meeting or other documents sent therewith) before the commencement of the general meeting, or adjourned meeting, at which the instrument or proxy is used.

Such appointment or removal shall be by notice to the Registered Office signed by the Director making or revoking the appointment or in any other manner approved by the Directors, and shall be effective on the date the notice is served and the alternate shall be notified of such appointment or revocation.

An alternate Director shall be deemed for all purposes to be a Director and shall alone be responsible for his own acts and defaults and shall not be deemed to be the agent of the Director appointing him. The signature of an alternate to any resolution in writing of the Director or a committee there shall, unless the terms of the appointment provides to the contrary, be as effective as the signature of the Director or Directors to whom he is alternate. 28 Committees of Directors 124. The Directors may delegate any of their powers to committees consisting of such member or members of their body as they think fit; any committee so formed shall, in the exercise of the powers so delegated, conform to any regulations that may be imposed on it by the Directors. 125.

A committee may meet and adjourn as it thinks proper. Questions arising at any meeting shall be determined by a majority of votes of the members present and in case of an equality of votes the chairman shall not have a second or casting vote and the motion shall be deemed to have been lost. Officers 127. The Directors may appoint a Secretary and such other officers as they may from time to time consider necessary upon such terms as to duration of office, remuneration and otherwise as they may think fit. Such Secretary or other officers need not be Directors and in the case of the other officers may be ascribed such titles as the Directors may decide and the Directors may revoke or terminate any such election or appointment. Any such revocation or termination shall be without prejudice to any claim for any damages that such officer may have against the Company or the Company may have against such officer for any breach of any contract of service between him and the Company which may be involved in such revocation or termination. Save as provided in the Law or these Articles, the powers and duties of the officers of the Company shall be such (if any) as are determined from time to time by the Directors. DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION Remuneration 128. The remuneration to be paid to the Directors, if any, shall be determined by the Company in general meeting or, in the absence of such a determination, by the Directors. Expenses 129. Each Director shall also be entitled to be paid his reasonable travelling, hotel and other expenses properly incurred by him in connection with his attTerminationance at meetings of the Directors, committees of the Directors or general meetings of the Company, or otherwise in connection with the business of the Company, or to receive a fixed allowance in respect thereof as may be determined by the Directors, or a combination partly of one such method and partly the other. 29 Additional remuneration 130. The Directors may by resolution approve additional remuneration to any Director for services which in the opinion of the Directors go beyond the ordinary duties of a Director, and such extra remuneration shall be in addition to any remuneration provided for, by or pursuant to any other Article. SEALS AND DEEDS Use of Seal 131. The Directors may determine that the Company shall have a Seal, and if they so determine, shall provide for the safe custody of the Seal. The Seal shall only be used by the authority of the Directors and in the presence of a Director or the Secretary or such other person as the Directors may by resolution appoint for this purpose, and every instrument to which the Seal affixed shall be signed by the relevant person. Notwithstanding the above, annual returns and notices filed under the Law may be executed either as a deed or under Seal and in either case without the need for the authority of a resolution of the Directors. 30 Duplicate Seal 132. The Company may maintain in any place or places outside the Cayman Islands a facsimile of any Seal and such facsimile seal shall be affixed in the same way as if it were the Seal. Execution of deeds 133.

DIVIDTerminationS Payment of DividTerminations 134. The Directors may from time to time declare dividTerminations to be paid to the Members according to their rights and interests, including such interim dividTerminations as appear to the Directors to be justified by the position of the Company. The Directors may also pay any fixed cash dividTermination which is payable on any Shares of the Company half yearly or on such other dates, whenever the position of the Company, in the opinion of the Directors, justifies such payment. 135. No dividTermination shall be paid otherwise than out of profits or out of monies otherwise available for dividTermination in accordance with the Law. Calculation of DividTerminations 136. Subject to the rights of Members, if any, entitled to Shares with special rights as to dividTerminations, all dividTerminations shall be declared and paid according to the amount paid up on the Shares in respect of which the dividTermination is paid and any dividTermination on any class of Shares not fully paid shall be declared and paid according to the amounts paid on the Shares of that class, but if and so long as nothing is paid up on any of the Shares in the Company, dividTerminations may be declared and paid according to the number of Shares. No amount paid on a Share in advance of calls shall, while carrying interest, be treated for the purposes of this Article as paid on the Share. DividTerminations may be apportioned and paid pro rata according to the amounts paid-up on the Shares during any portion or portions of the period in respect of which the dividTermination is paid. 31 Deductions 137. The Directors may deduct from any dividTermination, distribution or other monies payable to a Member by the Company on or in respect of any Shares all sums of money (if any) presently payable by him to the Company on account of calls or otherwise in respect of Shares of the Company. Joint Holders 138. If several persons are registered as joint holders of any Share, any of them may give effectual receipts for any dividTermination or other money payable on or in respect of the Share. Payment method 139. Any dividTermination may be paid by cheque or warrant sent through the post to the address of the Member or person entitled thereto in the Register of Members or, in the case of joint holders addressed to the holder whose name stands first in the Register of Members in respect of the Shares at his registered address as appearing on the Register of Members or to such person and such address as the Member or person entitled or such joint holders as the case may be may direct in writing. Every such cheque or warrant shall, unless the holder or joint holders may in writing direct, be made payable to the order of the person to whom it is sent or to the order of the holder or, in the case of joint holders, to the order of the holder whose name stands first in the Register of Members in respect of such Shares, and shall be sent at his or their risk and payment of the cheque or warrant by the bank on which it is drawn shall constitute a good discharge to the Company. Any one of two or more joint holders may give effectual receipts for any dividTerminations, distributions or other monies payable or property distributable in respect of the Shares held by such joint holders. Satisfaction by distribution of specific assets 140. The Directors may declare that any dividTermination or distribution is paid wholly or partly by the distribution of specific assets and, in particular, of paid up shares, debentures or debenture stock of any other company or in any one or more of such ways, and where any difficulty arises in regard to such dividTermination or distribution, the Directors may settle the same as they think expedient, and in particular may issue fractional Shares or ignore fractions altogether and may fix the value for dividTermination or distribution of such specific assets or any part thereof and may determine that cash payments shall be made to any Members upon the basis of the value so fixed in order to secure equality of distribution, and may vest any such specific assets in trustees as may seem expedient to the Directors. 32 No interest 141. No dividTermination or other distribution or other monies payable by the Company on or in respect of any Share shall bear interest against the Company. Unclaimed dividTerminations 142. All unclaimed dividTerminations or distributions may be invested or otherwise made use of by the Directors for the benefit of the Company until claimed. Any dividTermination or distribution unclaimed by a Member six years after the dividTermination or distribution payment date shall be forfeited and revert to the Company. RESERVES 143. The Directors may, before declaring any dividTermination or distribution, set aside such sums as they think proper as a reserve or reserves which shall, at the discretion of the Directors, be applicable for meeting contingencies, or for equalising dividTerminations, or for any other purpose of the Company, and pTerminationing such application may, in their discretion, be employed in the business of the Company or be invested in such manner as the Directors may from time to time think fit. The Directors may also without placing the same to reserve carry forward any sums which they think it prudent not to distribute. CAPITALISATION OF PROFITS Capitalisation 144. The Directors may capitalise any sum standing to the credit of any of the Company’s reserve accounts which are available for distribution (including its Share Premium Account and capital redemption reserve fund, subject to the Law) or any sum standing to the credit of the profit and loss account or otherwise available for distribution and to appropriate such sums to Members in the proportions in which such sum would have been divisible amongst them had the same been a distribution of profits by way of dividTermination and to apply such sum on their behalf in paying up in full unissued Shares for allotment and distribution credited as fully paid-up to and amongst them in the proportion aforesaid. Authorisation 145. Where any difficulty arises in regard to any distribution under the last preceding Article, the Directors may settle the same as they think expedient and, in particular, may authorise any person to sell and Assignment any fractions or may resolve that the distribution should be as nearly as may be practicable in the correct proportion but not exactly so or may ignore fractions altogether, and may determine that cash payments should be made to any Members in order to adjust the rights of all parties, as may seem expedient to the Directors. The Directors may appoint any person to sign on behalf of the persons entitled to participate in the distribution any contract necessary or desirable for giving effect thereto and such appointment shall be effective and binding upon the Members. 33 SHARE PREMIUM ACCOUNT 146. The Directors shall in accordance with the Law establish a Share Premium Account and shall carry to the credit of such account from time to time a sum equal to the amount or value of the premium paid on the issue of any Share. 147. There shall be debited to any Share Premium Account on the redemption or purchase of a Share the difference between the nominal value of such Share and the redemption or purchase price provided always that at the discretion of the Directors such sum may be paid out of the profits of the Company or, if permitted by the Law, out of capital.

The Directors shall cause to be kept accounting records sufficient to give a true and fair view of the state of the Company's affairs and to show and explain its transactions and otherwise in accordance with the Law. Inspection by Members 149. The accounting records shall be kept at the Registered Office or at such other place or places as the Directors think fit, and shall at all times be open to inspection by the Directors. No Member (who is not also a Director) shall have any right to inspect any accounting record or book or document of the Company except as conferred by law or authorised by the Directors or by the Members by Ordinary Resolution. Records and audit 150. From time to time the Company in general meeting may determine (or revoke, alter or amTermination any such determination) or, failing such determination, the Directors may determine (or revoke, alter or amTermination any such determination): 150.1 that the accounts of the Company be audited and the appointment of the Auditors; 150.2 that there be prepared and sent to each Member and other person entitled thereto a profit and loss account, a balance sheet, group accounts and/or reports for such period and on such terms as they may determine; and 150.3 that there be laid before the Company in general meeting a copy of every balance sheet together with a copy of the Auditor's report. 34 SERVICE OF NOTICES AND DOCUMENTS Form and delivery of notices 151. Notices or other documents or communications may be given to any Member by the Company either personally or by sTerminationing it by courier, post, fax or email to him to his registered address, or (if he has no registered address) to the address, if any, supplied by him to the Company for the giving of notices to him. Any notice shall be deemed to be effected: 151.1 if delivered personally or sent by courier, by properly addressing and prepaying a letter containing the notice; and to have been effected, in the case of a notice of a meeting, when delivered; 151.2 if sent by post, by properly addressing, prepaying, and posting a letter containing the notice (by airmail if available) and to have been effected, in the case of a notice of a meeting, at the Termination of three days after it was posted; and 151.3 if sent by fax or email by properly addressing and sTerminationing such notice through the appropriate transmitting medium and to have been effected on the day the same is sent. 152.

A notice may be given by the Company to the person entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a Member by sTerminationing it through the post in a prepaid letter addressed to them by name, or by the title of representatives of the deceased, or trustee of the bankrupt, or by any like description, at the address, if any, supplied for the purpose by the persons claiming to be so entitled, or (until such an address has been so supplied) by giving the notice in any manner in which the same might have been given if the death or bankruptcy had not occurred. 154. Notice of every general meeting shall be given in any manner hereinbefore authorised to: 154.1 every Member entitled to vote except those Members entitled to vote who (having no registered address) have not supplied to the Company an address for the giving of notices to them; and 154.2 every person entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a Member, who, but for his death or bankruptcy would be entitled to receive notice of the meeting. 155. No other persons shall be entitled to receive notices of general meeting. 35 WINDING UP Method of winding up 156. Subject to the rights attaching to any Shares, if the Company shall be wound up, the liquidator may, with the sanction of a Special Resolution and any other sanction required by the Law or these Articles, divide amongst the Members in kind the whole or any part of the assets of the Company (whether they shall consist of property of the same kind or not) and may for such purpose set such value as he deems fair upon any property to be divided as aforesaid and may determine how such division shall be carried out as between the Members or different classes of Members. The liquidator may, with the like sanction, vest the whole or any part of such assets in trustees upon such trusts for the benefit of the contributories as the liquidator, with the like sanction, shall think fit, but so that no Member shall be compelled to accept any asset upon which there is any liability. Distribution of assets 157. If the Company shall be wound up and the assets available for distribution amongst the Members as such shall be insufficient to repay the whole of the paid up capital, such assets shall be distributed so that, as nearly as may be, the losses shall be borne by the Members in proportion to the capital paid up, or which ought to have been paid up, at the commencement of the winding up, on the Shares held by them respectively. And if in a winding up the assets available for distribution amongst the Members shall be more than sufficient to repay the whole of the capital paid up at the commencement of the winding up, the excess shall be distributed amongst the Members in proportion to the capital paid up at the commencement of the winding up on the Shares held by them respectively. This Article is to be without prejudice to the rights of the holders of Shares issued upon special terms and conditions. Indemnification Indemnification and limitation of liability 158. Every Indemnified Person shall, in the absence of wilful neglect or default, be indemnified and held harmless out of the assets of the Company against all liabilities, loss, damage, cost or expense (including but not limited to liabilities under contract, tort and statute or any applicable foreign law or regulation and all reasonable legal and other costs and expenses on a full Indemnification basis properly payable) incurred or suffered by him by or by reason of any act done, conceived in or omitted in the conduct of the Company’s business or in the discharge of his duties and the Indemnification contained in this Article shall extTermination to any Indemnified Person acting in any office or trust in the reasonable belief that he has been appointed or elected to such office or trust notwithstanding any defect in such appointment or election. 36 159. No Indemnified Person shall be liable to the Company for acts, defaults or omissions of any other Indemnified Person. Indemnification and reimbursement 160. Every Indemnified Person shall be indemnified out of the funds of the Company against all liabilities incurred by him by or by reason of any act done, conceived in or omitted in the conduct of the Company’s business or in the discharge of his duties in defTerminationing any proceedings, whether civil or criminal, in which judgment is given in his favour, or in which he is acquitted, or in connection with any application in which relief from liability is granted to him by the court. 161. To the extent that any Indemnified Person is entitled to claim an Indemnification pursuant to these Articles in respect of amounts paid or discharged by him, the relative Indemnification shall take effect as an obligation of the Company to reimburse the person making such payment or effecting such discharge. Wilful neglect or default 162. Each Member and the Company agree to waive any claim or right of action he or it may at any time have, whether individually or by or in the right of the Company, against any Indemnified Person on account of any act or omission of such Indemnified Person in the performance of his duties for the Company; provided however, that such waiver shall not apply to any claims or rights of action arising out of the wilful neglect or default of such Indemnified Person or to recover any gain, personal profit or advantage to which such Indemnified Person is not legally entitled. Advance of legal fees 163. Expenses incurred in defTerminationing any civil or criminal action or proceeding for which indemnification is required pursuant to these Articles shall be paid by the Company in advance of the final disposition of such action or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnified Person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that the Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified pursuant to these Articles. Each Member of the Company shall be deemed to have acknowledged and agreed that the advances of funds may be made by the Company as aforesaid, and when made by the Company under this Article are made to meet expTerminationitures incurred for the purpose of enabling such Indemnified Person to properly perform his or her duties to the Company. 37 CONTINUATION 164. The Company shall have the power, subject to the provisions of the Law and with the approval of a Special Resolution, to continue as a body incorporated under the laws of any jurisdiction outside of the Cayman Islands and to be de-registered in the Cayman Islands.

The Directors may also suspTermination the registration of the Assignments at such times and for such periods as the Directors may from time to time determine. TRANSMISSION OF SHARES Transmission of Shares 21. If a Member dies, the survivor or survivors (where he was a joint holder), and the legal personal representative (where he was sole holder), shall be the only person recognised by the Company as having any title to the Share. The estate of a deceased Member is not thereby released from any liability in respect of any Share held by him, whether solely or jointly. For the purpose of this Article, legal personal representative means the person to whom probate or letters of administration has or have been granted in the Cayman Islands or, if there is no such person, such other person as the Directors may in their absolute discretion determine to be the person recognised by the Company for the purpose of this Article. Election by persons entitled on transmission 22. Any person becoming entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a Member or otherwise by operation of Governing Law may elect, upon such evidence being produced as may be required by the Directors as to his entitlement, either be registered himself as a Member in respect of the Share or, instead of being registered himself, to make such Assignment of the Share as the deceased or bankrupt Member could have made. 7 Manner of election 23. If the person so becoming entitled elects to be registered himself, he shall deliver or sTermination to the Company a notice in writing signed by him stating that he so elects. If he shall elect to Assignment the Shares, he shall signify his election by signing an instrument of Assignment of such Shares in favour of his Assignmentee. All the limitations, restrictions and provisions of these Articles relating to the right to Assignment and the registration of Assignments of Shares shall be applicable to any such notice or instrument of Assignment as aforesaid as if the death of the Member or other event giving rise to the transmission had not occurred and the notice or instrument of Assignment was an instrument of Assignment signed by such Member. Rights of persons entitled on transmission 24. A person becoming entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of the Member (or otherwise by operation of Governing Law), upon such evidence being produced as may be required by the Directors as to his entitlement, shall be entitled to the same dividTerminations and other monies payable in respect of the Share as he would be entitled if he were the holder of such Share. However, he shall not be entitled, until he becomes registered as the holder of such Share, to receive notices of or to attTermination or vote at general meetings of the Company or (except as aforesaid) to exercise any other rights or privileges of a Member. The Directors may at any time give notice requiring such person to elect either to be registered himself or to Assignment the Share and, if the notice is not complied with within sixty days, the Directors may thereafter withhold payment of all dividTerminations and other monies payable in respect of the Shares until the requirements of the notice have been complied with. REDEMPTION AND PURCHASE OF SHARES 25. Subject to the provisions of the Law and the Memorandum, the Company may: 25.1 purchase its own Shares (including any redeemable Shares) in such manner and on such terms as the Directors may agree with the relevant Member unless following such purchase there would no longer be any issued Shares and may make payment for such purchase or for any redemption of Shares in any manner authorised by the Law, including out of capital; and 25.2 reduce its share capital and any capital redemption reserve fund in any manner whatsoever. 8 VARIATION OF SHARE RIGHTS Variation of class rights 26. If at any time the share capital is divided into different classes of Shares, all or any of the special rights attached to any class of Shares (unless otherwise provided by the terms of issue of the Shares of that class) may be varied or abrogated with the consent in writing of the holders of not less than two thirds of the issued Shares of that class or with the sanction of a resolution passed by the holders of not less than two thirds of the issued Shares of that class as may be present in person or by proxy at a separate general meeting of the holders of the Shares of that class. To any such separate general meeting, all of the provisions of these Articles relating to general meetings shall mutatis mutandis apply, but so that the necessary quorum shall be any one or more persons holding or representing by proxy not less than one third of the issued Shares of the class and that any holder of Shares of the relevant class present in person or by proxy may demand a poll. Treatment of classes 27. For the purpose of a separate class meeting, the Directors may treat two or more of all classes of Shares as forming one class if they consider that such class of Shares would be affected in the same way by the proposals under consideration. Effect of Share issue on class rights 28. The rights conferred upon the holders of any Shares shall not, unless otherwise expressly provided in the rights attaching to such Shares, be deemed to be altered by the creation or issue of further Shares ranking pari passu therewith. NON-RECOGNITION OF TRUSTS 29. Except as required by the Law or these Articles, or under an order of a court of competent jurisdiction, the Company shall not be bound by or compelled to recognise in any way, even when notice thereof is given to it, any equitable, contingent, future or partial interest in any Share, or any other rights in respect of any Share other than an absolute right to the entirety thereof in the registered holder. 9 LIEN Lien generally 30. The Company shall have a first and paramount lien on every Share (not being a fully paid Share) for all moneys (whether presently payable or not) called or payable at a date fixed by or in accordance with the terms of issue of such Share in respect of that Share, and the Company shall also have a first and paramount lien on every Share (other than a fully paid up Share) standing registered in the name of a Member, whether singly or jointly with any other person for all debts and liabilities of a Member or his estate to the Company, whether the same shall have been incurred before or after notice to the Company of any interest of any person other than such Member, and whether the time for the payment or discharge of the same shall have actually arrived or not, and notwithstanding that the same are joint debts or liabilities of such Member or his estate and any other person, whether a Member or not. The Directors may at any time, either generally or in any particular case, waive any lien that has arisen or declare any Share to be wholly or in part exempt from the provisions of this Article. The Company's lien, if any, on a Share shall extTermination to all dividTerminations payable thereon. Enforcement 31. The Company may sell, in such manner as the Directors think fit, any Share on which the Company has a lien, provided a sum in respect of which the lien exists is presently payable, and is not paid within fourteen days after a notice in writing has been given to the registered holder  for the time being of the Share, demanding payment of the sum presently payable and giving notice of the intention to sell in default of such payment. Completion of sale 32. For giving effect to any such sale, the Directors may authorise any person to Assignment the Share sold to the purchaser thereof. The purchaser shall be registered as the holder of the Share comprised in any such Assignment and he shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money, nor shall his title to the Share be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings relating to the sale. Application of proceeds 33. The net proceeds of such sale shall be applied in payment or discharge of the debt or liability in respect of which the lien exists and as is presently payable, and any balance shall (subject to a like lien for debts or liabilities not presently payable as existed upon the Shares prior to the sale) be paid to the person who was the registered holder of the Share immediately before such sale. CALLS ON SHARES Calls on Shares generally 34. The Directors may from time to time make calls upon the Members in respect of any moneys unpaid on their Shares (whether in respect of the par value of the Shares or premium or otherwise and not, by the terms of issue thereof, made payable at a future date fixed by or in accordance with such terms of issue); and each Member shall (subject to the Company serving upon him at least 14 days’ notice specifying the time or times and place of payment) pay to the Company at the time or times and place so specified the amount called on his Shares. A call may be revoked or postponed by the Directors wholly or in part as the Directors may determine. A call shall be deemed to have been made at the time when the resolution of the Directors authorising the call was passed. 10 Payment 35. Payment of a call may be made by instalments on the direction of the Directors. 36. If a sum called in respect of a Share is not paid before or on the day appointed for payment thereof, the person from whom the sum is due shall pay interest on the sum from the day payment is due to the time of the actual payment at such rate as the Directors may determine, but the Directors may waive payment of such interest wholly or in part. 37. Any sum payable in respect of a Share on issue or allotment or at any fixed date, whether in respect of the par value of the Share or premium or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a call and if it is not paid all the relevant provisions as to payment of interest, forfeiture or otherwise of these Articles shall apply as if such sum had become due and payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified. 38. The Directors may issue Shares with different terms as to the amount and times of payment of calls. Liability of joint holders 39. The joint holders of a Share shall be jointly and severally liable to pay calls in respect thereof. Interest 40. The Directors may, if they think fit, receive from any Member willing to advance the same, all or any part of the moneys uncalled and unpaid upon any Shares held by him; and may (until the amount would otherwise become payable) pay interest at such rate (not exceeding six per cent without the sanction of the Company in general meeting) as may be agreed upon between the Member paying the sum in advance and the Directors. FORFEITURE OF SHARES Notice 41. If a Member fails to pay any call or instalment of a call by the date it becomes due and payable, the Directors may, at any time thereafter while such call or instalment remains unpaid, give notice to the Member requiring payment of the unpaid portion of the call or instalment, together with any accrued interest and expenses incurred by the Company by reason of such non-payment. 11 42. The notice shall specify where and by what date (not being less than the Termination of 14 days’ from the date of the notice) payment is to be made and shall state that if it is not complied with the Shares in respect of which the call was made will be liable to be forfeited. The Directors may accept the surrTerminationer of any Share liable to be forfeited hereunder and, in such case, references to these Articles to forfeiture shall include surrTerminationer. Forfeiture for non-compliance 43. If such notice is not complied with, any Share in respect of which the notice was given may thereafter, before the payment of all calls or instalments and interest due in respect thereof has been made, be forfeited by a resolution of the Directors. Such forfeiture shall include all dividTerminations declared, other distributions or other monies payable in respect of the forfeited Shares and not paid before the forfeiture. Forfeited Shares 44. A forfeited Share may be sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed of upon such terms and in such manner as the Directors shall think fit, and at any time before a sale, re-allotment or disposition, the forfeiture may be cancelled on such terms as the Directors think fit. Continued liability for forfeited Member 45. A person whose Shares have been forfeited shall cease to be a Member in respect of the forfeited Shares, but shall remain liable to pay to the Company all moneys which at the date of forfeiture were presently payable by him in respect of the Shares together with interest at such rate as the Directors may determine from the date of forfeiture until payment, but his liability shall cease if and when the Company receives payment in full of all amounts due in respect of the Shares. The Company may enforce payment without being under any obligation to make any allowance for the value of the Shares forfeited. Evidence of forfeiture 46. An affidavit in writing by a Director or Secretary of the Company that a Share has been duly forfeited on a specified date, shall be conclusive evidence of the facts stated in it as against all persons claiming to be entitled to the Share. The Company may receive the consideration, if any, given for the Share on any sale, re-allotment or disposition thereof and may authorise some person to execute a Assignment of the Share in favour of the person to whom the Share is sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed of, and he shall thereupon be registered as the holder of the Share, and shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money (if any) nor shall his title to the Share be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings in reference to the forfeiture, sale, re-allotment or disposition of the Share. 12 47. The provisions of these Articles as to forfeiture shall apply in the case of non-payment of any sum which, by the terms of issue of a Share, becomes payable at a fixed time, whether on account of the par value of the Share, or by way of premium or otherwise, as if the same had been made payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified to the Member. INCREASE OF CAPITAL 48. The Company may from time to time by Ordinary Resolution increase its share capital by such sum, to be divided into new Shares of such par value, and with such rights, priorities and privileges attached thereto as the resolution shall prescribe. 49. Subject to any directions given by the Company in a general meeting, all new Shares shall be at the disposal of the Directors in accordance with these Articles. 50. The new Shares shall be subject to the same provisions of these Articles with reference to the payment of calls, lien, forfeiture, Assignment, transmission and otherwise, as the Shares in the original share capital. ALTERATION OF CAPITAL 51. The Company may from time to time by Ordinary Resolution: 51.1 consolidate and divide all or any of its share capital into Shares of larger par value than its existing Shares; 51.2 sub divide its existing Shares, or any of them, into Shares of smaller par value than is fixed by the Memorandum, subject nevertheless to the provisions of section 13 of the Law; 51.3 cancel any Shares which, at the date of the passing of the resolution, have not been taken or agreed to be taken by any person; and 51.4 convert all or any paid up Shares into stock, and reconvert all or any stock into paid up Shares of any denomination. 52. The Company may from time to time by Special Resolution: 52.1 divide its Shares into several classes and attach to such classes any preferential, deferred, or special rights or restrictions in accordance with these Articles; 52.2 change the currency denomination of its share capital; 13 52.3 reduce its share capital and any capital redemption reserve fund in any manner whatsoever; and 52.4 merge or consolidate with any one or more constituent companies (as defined in the Law).

If at any time there are not sufficient Directors capable of acting to form a quorum, any Director, or any one or more Members holding in the aggregate not less than one third of the total issued share capital of the Company entitled to vote, may convene an extraordinary general meeting in the same manner as nearly as possible as that in which meetings may be convened by the Directors. Members’ requisition 54. The Directors shall, upon the requisition in writing of one or more Members holding in the aggregate not less than one tenth of such paid up capital of the Company as at the date of the requisition carries the right of voting at general meetings, convene an extraordinary general meeting. Any such requisition shall express the object of the meeting proposed to be called, and must be signed by the requisitionists and deposited at the Registered Office, and may consist of several documents in like form, each signed by one or more requisitionists. 55.

A general meeting may be convened by such shorter notice, or without notice, by a majority in number of the Members having the right to attTermination and vote at the meeting, being a majority together holding not less than ninety-five percent in nominal value of the Shares giving that right. 14 Omission or non-receipt 57.

In any other case, it shall stand adjourned to the same day in the next week, at the same time and place, and if at the adjourned meeting a quorum is not present within half an hour from the time appointed for the meeting, the Members present shall be a quorum. Meeting by telephone or other facilities 61. A meeting of the Members may be held by telephone, electronic or other communication facilities (including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, by telephone or video conferencing) by which all persons participating in the meeting can communicate with each other simultaneously and instantaneously, and participation in such a general meeting shall constitute presence in person at such meeting. 62. Any Director shall be entitled to attTermination and speak at any general meeting of the Company. 15 Appointment of chairman 63. The chairman (if any) of the Board of Directors shall preside as chairman at every general meeting of the Company.

If no Director is present, or if each of the Directors present declines to take the chair, the Members present and entitled to vote shall elect one of their number to be chairman. Adjournment of meeting 64. The chairman may, with the consent of a meeting at which a quorum is present (and shall if so directed by the meeting) adjourn the meeting from time to time and from place to place, but no business shall be transacted at any adjourned meeting other than the business left unfinished at the meeting from which the adjournment took place. When a meeting is adjourned for ten days or more, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given as in the case of an original meeting. Save as aforesaid, it shall not be necessary to give any notice of an adjournment or of the business to be transacted at an adjourned meeting. VOTING Ordinary Resolution Save where a Special Resolution or other greater majority is required by the Law or these Articles, any question proposed for consideration at any general meeting shall be decided by an Ordinary Resolution. Voting on a show of hands 65. At any general meeting, a resolution put to the vote of the meeting shall be decided on a show of hands, unless before or on the declaration of the result of the show of hands, or on the withdrawal of any other demand for a poll. Demand for poll 66. A poll is demanded by: 66.1 the chairman of the meeting; or 66.2 at least three Members present in person or by proxy; or 66.3 any Member or Members present in person or by proxy and holding collectively not less than one tenth of the total voting rights of all the Members having the right to vote at such meeting; or 16 66.4 a Member or Members present in person or by proxy holding Shares conferring the right to vote at such meeting, being Shares on which an aggregate sum has been paid up equal to not less than one tenth of the total sum paid up on all such Shares conferring such right. 67. Unless a poll is duly demanded and the demand is not withdrawn, a declaration by the chairman that a resolution has, on a show of hands, been carried or carried unanimously, or by a particular majority, or lost and an entry to that effect in the minutes of the proceedings of the Company shall be conclusive evidence of that fact, without proof of the number or proportion of the votes recorded in favour of, or against, that resolution. The demand for a poll may be withdrawn by the person or any persons making it at any time prior to the declaration of the result of the poll. 68. If a poll is duly demanded, it shall be taken in such manner as the chairman directs, and the result of the poll shall be deemed to be the resolution of the meeting at which the poll was demanded. 69. In the case of an equality of votes at a general meeting, whether on a show of hands or on a poll, the chairman of the meeting at which the show of hands takes place or at which the poll is demanded, shall not be entitled to a second or casting vote and the resolution shall fail. 70. A poll demanded on the election of a chairman or on a question of adjournment shall be taken forthwith. A poll demanded on any other question shall be taken in such manner and either forthwith or at such time later in the meeting as the chairman of the meeting shall direct. 71.

Voting on a poll 72. On a poll votes may be cast either personally or by proxy. 73. A person entitled to more than one vote on a poll need not use all his votes or cast all the votes he uses in the same way. 74. On a show of hands, every Member present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall have one vote. On a poll, every Member present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall have one vote for each Share of which he is the registered holder. 17 75. In the case of joint holders of a Share, the vote of the senior who tTerminationers a vote, whether in person or by proxy, shall be accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint holders; and for this purpose seniority shall be determined by the order in which the names stand in the Register of Members in respect of the joint holding. 76. A Member of unsound mind, or, in respect of whom an order has been made by any court having jurisdiction in lunacy, may vote, whether on a show of hands or on a poll, by his receiver, committee, curator bonis or other person of similar nature appointed by such court, and any such receiver, committee, curator bonis or other person may vote by proxy and may otherwise act and be treated as such Member for the purpose of the general meetings. 77. No Member, unless the Directors otherwise determine, shall be entitled to vote at any general meeting, unless all calls or other sums presently payable by him in respect of Shares in the Company have been paid. 78. No objection shall be raised as to the qualification of any voter or as to whether any votes have been properly counted except at the general meeting or adjourned general meeting at which the vote objected to is given or tTerminationered and every vote not disallowed at the meeting shall be valid. Any objection made in due time and in accordance with these Articles shall be referred to the chairman whose decision shall be final and conclusive. Shareholder Restricted Matters 78A.

All acts done by any meeting of the Directors or of a committee of Directors, or by any person acting as a Director shall, notwithstanding that it be afterwards discovered that there was some defect in the appointment of any such Director or person acting as aforesaid, or that they or any of them were disqualified, be as valid as if every such person had been duly appointed and was qualified to be a Director. Minutes 112. The Directors shall cause minutes to be made and records kept for the purpose of recording: 26 112.1 all appointments of officers made by the Directors; 112.2 the names of the Directors and other persons present at each meeting of the Directors and of any committee of the Directors; and 112.3 all resolutions and proceedings at all meetings of the Members of the Company or any class of Members and of the Directors and of committees of Directors; and the chairman of all such meetings or of any meeting confirming the minutes thereof shall sign the same. DIRECTORS’ INTERESTS 113.

A Director or officer may act by himself or his firm in a professional capacity for the Company (otherwise than as Auditor), and he or his firm shall be entitled to remuneration for professional services as if he were not a Director or officer. 115. No Director or officer shall be disqualified from his office or prevented by such office from holding any office or place of profit under the Company or under any company in which the Company shall be a Member or have any interest, or from contracting with the Company, either as vTerminationor, purchaser or otherwise, nor shall any such contract or any contract or transaction entered into by or on behalf of the Company in which any Director or officer shall be in any way interested be or be liable to be avoided nor shall any Director or officer so contracting, dealing or being so interested be liable to account to the Company for any profit realised by any such contract or transaction by reason of such Director holding office or of the fiduciary relation thereby established. Disclosure and nature of interest 116. A Director (or his alternate Director in his absence) shall be at liberty to vote in respect of any contract or transaction in which he is interested provided that the nature of the interest of the Director in any such contract or transaction shall be disclosed by him at or prior to its consideration and any vote thereon. 117.

Directors may from time to time and at any time by power of attorney or otherwise appoint any company, firm or person or fluctuating body of persons, whether nominated directly or indirectly by the Directors, to be the attorney or attorneys of the Company for such purposes and with such powers, authorities and discretions (not exceeding those vested in or exercisable by the Directors under these Articles) and for such period and subject to such conditions as they may think fit, and any such power of attorney may contain such provisions for the protection and convenience of persons dealing with any such attorney and of such attorney as the Directors may think fit and may also authorise any such attorney to delegate all or any of the powers, authorities and discretions vested in him. 119. The Directors may delegate any of the powers exercisable by them to a Managing Director , Director or any other person or persons acting individually or jointly as they may from time to time by resolution appoint upon such terms and conditions and with such restrictions as they may think fit, and may from time to time by resolution revoke, withdraw, alter or vary all or any such powers. Alternate Directors 120. Any Director may by writing appoint any other Director, or other person willing to act, to be his alternate and remove his alternate so appointed by him. Such appointment or removal shall be by notice to the Registered Office signed by the Director making or revoking the appointment or in any other manner approved by the Directors, and shall be effective on the date the notice is served and the alternate shall be notified of such appointment or revocation. Subject to the removal by the appointing Director, the alternate shall continue in office until the date on which his appointor ceases to be a Director. An alternate may also be a Director in his own right and may act as alternate to more than one Director. 121. An alternate shall be entitled to receive notice of all meetings of the Directors, attTermination, be counted in the quorum, vote and act in such appointor’s place at every such meeting at which the appointing Director is not personally present, and generally to perform all the functions of his appointor as a Director in his absence. 122. These Articles (except as regards powers to appoint an alternate and remuneration) apply equally to the alternate as though he were the Director in his own right. 123. An alternate Director shall be deemed for all purposes to be a Director and shall alone be responsible for his own acts and defaults and shall not be deemed to be the agent of the Director appointing him. The signature of an alternate to any resolution in writing of the Director or a committee there shall, unless the terms of the appointment provides to the contrary, be as effective as the signature of the Director or Directors to whom he is alternate. 28 Committees of Directors 124. The Directors may delegate any of their powers to committees consisting of such member or members of their body as they think fit; any committee so formed shall, in the exercise of the powers so delegated, conform to any regulations that may be imposed on it by the Directors. 125. A committee may elect a chairman of its meetings; if no such chairman is elected, or if at any meeting the chairman is not present within five minutes after the time appointed for holding the same, the members present may choose one of their number to be chairman of the meeting. 126. A committee may meet and adjourn as it thinks proper. Questions arising at any meeting shall be determined by a majority of votes of the members present and in case of an equality of votes the chairman shall not have a second or casting vote and the motion shall be deemed to have been lost. Officers 127. The Directors may appoint a Secretary and such other officers as they may from time to time consider necessary upon such terms as to duration of office, remuneration and otherwise as they may think fit. Such Secretary or other officers need not be Directors and in the case of the other officers may be ascribed such titles as the Directors may decide and the Directors may revoke or terminate any such election or appointment. Any such revocation or termination shall be without prejudice to any claim for any damages that such officer may have against the Company or the Company may have against such officer for any breach of any contract of service between him and the Company which may be involved in such revocation or termination. Save as provided in the Law or these Articles, the powers and duties of the officers of the Company shall be such (if any) as are determined from time to time by the Directors. DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION Remuneration 128. The remuneration to be paid to the Directors, if any, shall be determined by the Company in general meeting or, in the absence of such a determination, by the Directors. Expenses 129. Each Director shall also be entitled to be paid his reasonable travelling, hotel and other expenses properly incurred by him in connection with his attTerminationance at meetings of the Directors, committees of the Directors or general meetings of the Company, or otherwise in connection with the business of the Company, or to receive a fixed allowance in respect thereof as may be determined by the Directors, or a combination partly of one such method and partly the other. 29 Additional remuneration 130. The Directors may by resolution approve additional remuneration to any Director for services which in the opinion of the Directors go beyond the ordinary duties of a Director, and such extra remuneration shall be in addition to any remuneration provided for, by or pursuant to any other Article. SEALS AND DEEDS Use of Seal 131. The Directors may determine that the Company shall have a Seal, and if they so determine, shall provide for the safe custody of the Seal. The Seal shall only be used by the authority of the Directors and in the presence of a Director or the Secretary or such other person as the Directors may by resolution appoint for this purpose, and every instrument to which the Seal affixed shall be signed by the relevant person. Notwithstanding the above, annual returns and notices filed under the Law may be executed either as a deed or under Seal and in either case without the need for the authority of a resolution of the Directors. 30 Duplicate Seal 132. The Company may maintain in any place or places outside the Cayman Islands a facsimile of any Seal and such facsimile seal shall be affixed in the same way as if it were the Seal. Execution of deeds 133. In accordance with the Law, the Company may execute any deed or other instrument (which would otherwise be required to be executed under Seal) by the signature of such deed or instrument as a deed by a Director or by the Secretary of the Company or by such other person as the Directors may appoint or by any other person or attorney on behalf of the Company appointed by a deed or other instrument executed as a deed by a Director or the Secretary or such other person as aforesaid. DIVIDTerminationS Payment of DividTerminations 134. The Directors may from time to time declare dividTerminations to be paid to the Members according to their rights and interests, including such interim dividTerminations as appear to the Directors to be justified by the position of the Company. The Directors may also pay any fixed cash dividTermination which is payable on any Shares of the Company half yearly or on such other dates, whenever the position of the Company, in the opinion of the Directors, justifies such payment. 135. No dividTermination shall be paid otherwise than out of profits or out of monies otherwise available for dividTermination in accordance with the Law. Calculation of DividTerminations 136. Subject to the rights of Members, if any, entitled to Shares with special rights as to dividTerminations, all dividTerminations shall be declared and paid according to the amount paid up on the Shares in respect of which the dividTermination is paid and any dividTermination on any class of Shares not fully paid shall be declared and paid according to the amounts paid on the Shares of that class, but if and so long as nothing is paid up on any of the Shares in the Company, dividTerminations may be declared and paid according to the number of Shares. No amount paid on a Share in advance of calls shall, while carrying interest, be treated for the purposes of this Article as paid on the Share. DividTerminations may be apportioned and paid pro rata according to the amounts paid-up on the Shares during any portion or portions of the period in respect of which the dividTermination is paid. 31 Deductions 137. The Directors may deduct from any dividTermination, distribution or other monies payable to a Member by the Company on or in respect of any Shares all sums of money (if any) presently payable by him to the Company on account of calls or otherwise in respect of Shares of the Company. Joint Holders 138. If several persons are registered as joint holders of any Share, any of them may give effectual receipts for any dividTermination or other money payable on or in respect of the Share. Payment method 139. Any dividTermination may be paid by cheque or warrant sent through the post to the address of the Member or person entitled thereto in the Register of Members or, in the case of joint holders addressed to the holder whose name stands first in the Register of Members in respect of the Shares at his registered address as appearing on the Register of Members or to such person and such address as the Member or person entitled or such joint holders as the case may be may direct in writing. Every such cheque or warrant shall, unless the holder or joint holders may in writing direct, be made payable to the order of the person to whom it is sent or to the order of the holder or, in the case of joint holders, to the order of the holder whose name stands first in the Register of Members in respect of such Shares, and shall be sent at his or their risk and payment of the cheque or warrant by the bank on which it is drawn shall constitute a good discharge to the Company. Any one of two or more joint holders may give effectual receipts for any dividTerminations, distributions or other monies payable or property distributable in respect of the Shares held by such joint holders. Satisfaction by distribution of specific assets 140. The Directors may declare that any dividTermination or distribution is paid wholly or partly by the distribution of specific assets and, in particular, of paid up shares, debentures or debenture stock of any other company or in any one or more of such ways, and where any difficulty arises in regard to such dividTermination or distribution, the Directors may settle the same as they think expedient, and in particular may issue fractional Shares or ignore fractions altogether and may fix the value for dividTermination or distribution of such specific assets or any part thereof and may determine that cash payments shall be made to any Members upon the basis of the value so fixed in order to secure equality of distribution, and may vest any such specific assets in trustees as may seem expedient to the Directors. 32 No interest 141. No dividTermination or other distribution or other monies payable by the Company on or in respect of any Share shall bear interest against the Company. Unclaimed dividTerminations 142. All unclaimed dividTerminations or distributions may be invested or otherwise made use of by the Directors for the benefit of the Company until claimed. Any dividTermination or distribution unclaimed by a Member six years after the dividTermination or distribution payment date shall be forfeited and revert to the Company. RESERVES 143. The Directors may, before declaring any dividTermination or distribution, set aside such sums as they think proper as a reserve or reserves which shall, at the discretion of the Directors, be applicable for meeting contingencies, or for equalising dividTerminations, or for any other purpose of the Company, and pTerminationing such application may, in their discretion, be employed in the business of the Company or be invested in such manner as the Directors may from time to time think fit. The Directors may also without placing the same to reserve carry forward any sums which they think it prudent not to distribute. CAPITALISATION OF PROFITS Capitalisation 144. The Directors may capitalise any sum standing to the credit of any of the Company’s reserve accounts which are available for distribution (including its Share Premium Account and capital redemption reserve fund, subject to the Law) or any sum standing to the credit of the profit and loss account or otherwise available for distribution and to appropriate such sums to Members in the proportions in which such sum would have been divisible amongst them had the same been a distribution of profits by way of dividTermination and to apply such sum on their behalf in paying up in full unissued Shares for allotment and distribution credited as fully paid-up to and amongst them in the proportion aforesaid. Authorisation 145. Where any difficulty arises in regard to any distribution under the last preceding Article, the Directors may settle the same as they think expedient and, in particular, may authorise any person to sell and Assignment any fractions or may resolve that the distribution should be as nearly as may be practicable in the correct proportion but not exactly so or may ignore fractions altogether, and may determine that cash payments should be made to any Members in order to adjust the rights of all parties, as may seem expedient to the Directors. The Directors may appoint any person to sign on behalf of the persons entitled to participate in the distribution any contract necessary or desirable for giving effect thereto and such appointment shall be effective and binding upon the Members. 33 SHARE PREMIUM ACCOUNT 146. The Directors shall in accordance with the Law establish a Share Premium Account and shall carry to the credit of such account from time to time a sum equal to the amount or value of the premium paid on the issue of any Share. 147. There shall be debited to any Share Premium Account on the redemption or purchase of a Share the difference between the nominal value of such Share and the redemption or purchase price provided always that at the discretion of the Directors such sum may be paid out of the profits of the Company or, if permitted by the Law, out of capital. ACCOUNTING RECORDS Books of account 148. The Directors shall cause to be kept accounting records sufficient to give a true and fair view of the state of the Company's affairs and to show and explain its transactions and otherwise in accordance with the Law. Inspection by Members 149. The accounting records shall be kept at the Registered Office or at such other place or places as the Directors think fit, and shall at all times be open to inspection by the Directors. No Member (who is not also a Director) shall have any right to inspect any accounting record or book or document of the Company except as conferred by law or authorised by the Directors or by the Members by Ordinary Resolution. Records and audit 150. From time to time the Company in general meeting may determine (or revoke, alter or amTermination any such determination) or, failing such determination, the Directors may determine (or revoke, alter or amTermination any such determination): 150.1 that the accounts of the Company be audited and the appointment of the Auditors; 150.2 that there be prepared and sent to each Member and other person entitled thereto a profit and loss account, a balance sheet, group accounts and/or reports for such period and on such terms as they may determine; and 150.3 that there be laid before the Company in general meeting a copy of every balance sheet together with a copy of the Auditor's report. 34 SERVICE OF NOTICES AND DOCUMENTS Form and delivery of notices 151. Notices or other documents or communications may be given to any Member by the Company either personally or by sTerminationing it by courier, post, fax or email to him to his registered address, or (if he has no registered address) to the address, if any, supplied by him to the Company for the giving of notices to him. Any notice shall be deemed to be effected: 151.1 if delivered personally or sent by courier, by properly addressing and prepaying a letter containing the notice; and to have been effected, in the case of a notice of a meeting, when delivered; 151.2 if sent by post, by properly addressing, prepaying, and posting a letter containing the notice (by airmail if available) and to have been effected, in the case of a notice of a meeting, at the Termination of three days after it was posted; and 151.3 if sent by fax or email by properly addressing and sTerminationing such notice through the appropriate transmitting medium and to have been effected on the day the same is sent. 152. A notice may be given by the Company to the joint holders of a Share by giving the notice to the joint holder named first in the Register of Members in respect of the Share. 153. A notice may be given by the Company to the person entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a Member by sTerminationing it through the post in a prepaid letter addressed to them by name, or by the title of representatives of the deceased, or trustee of the bankrupt, or by any like description, at the address, if any, supplied for the purpose by the persons claiming to be so entitled, or (until such an address has been so supplied) by giving the notice in any manner in which the same might have been given if the death or bankruptcy had not occurred. 154. Notice of every general meeting shall be given in any manner hereinbefore authorised to: 154.1 every Member entitled to vote except those Members entitled to vote who (having no registered address) have not supplied to the Company an address for the giving of notices to them; and 154.2 every person entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a Member, who, but for his death or bankruptcy would be entitled to receive notice of the meeting. 155. No other persons shall be entitled to receive notices of general meeting. 35 WINDING UP Method of winding up 156. Subject to the rights attaching to any Shares, if the Company shall be wound up, the liquidator may, with the sanction of a Special Resolution and any other sanction required by the Law or these Articles, divide amongst the Members in kind the whole or any part of the assets of the Company (whether they shall consist of property of the same kind or not) and may for such purpose set such value as he deems fair upon any property to be divided as aforesaid and may determine how such division shall be carried out as between the Members or different classes of Members. The liquidator may, with the like sanction, vest the whole or any part of such assets in trustees upon such trusts for the benefit of the contributories as the liquidator, with the like sanction, shall think fit, but so that no Member shall be compelled to accept any asset upon which there is any liability. Distribution of assets 157. If the Company shall be wound up and the assets available for distribution amongst the Members as such shall be insufficient to repay the whole of the paid up capital, such assets shall be distributed so that, as nearly as may be, the losses shall be borne by the Members in proportion to the capital paid up, or which ought to have been paid up, at the commencement of the winding up, on the Shares held by them respectively. And if in a winding up the assets available for distribution amongst the Members shall be more than sufficient to repay the whole of the capital paid up at the commencement of the winding up, the excess shall be distributed amongst the Members in proportion to the capital paid up at the commencement of the winding up on the Shares held by them respectively. This Article is to be without prejudice to the rights of the holders of Shares issued upon special terms and conditions. Indemnification Indemnification and limitation of liability 158. Every Indemnified Person shall, in the absence of wilful neglect or default, be indemnified and held harmless out of the assets of the Company against all liabilities, loss, damage, cost or expense (including but not limited to liabilities under contract, tort and statute or any applicable foreign law or regulation and all reasonable legal and other costs and expenses on a full Indemnification basis properly payable) incurred or suffered by him by or by reason of any act done, conceived in or omitted in the conduct of the Company’s business or in the discharge of his duties and the Indemnification contained in this Article shall extTermination to any Indemnified Person acting in any office or trust in the reasonable belief that he has been appointed or elected to such office or trust notwithstanding any defect in such appointment or election. 36 159. No Indemnified Person shall be liable to the Company for acts, defaults or omissions of any other Indemnified Person. Indemnification and reimbursement 160. Every Indemnified Person shall be indemnified out of the funds of the Company against all liabilities incurred by him by or by reason of any act done, conceived in or omitted in the conduct of the Company’s business or in the discharge of his duties in defTerminationing any proceedings, whether civil or criminal, in which judgment is given in his favour, or in which he is acquitted, or in connection with any application in which relief from liability is granted to him by the court. 161. To the extent that any Indemnified Person is entitled to claim an Indemnification pursuant to these Articles in respect of amounts paid or discharged by him, the relative Indemnification shall take effect as an obligation of the Company to reimburse the person making such payment or effecting such discharge. Wilful neglect or default 162. Each Member and the Company agree to waive any claim or right of action he or it may at any time have, whether individually or by or in the right of the Company, against any Indemnified Person on account of any act or omission of such Indemnified Person in the performance of his duties for the Company; provided however, that such waiver shall not apply to any claims or rights of action arising out of the wilful neglect or default of such Indemnified Person or to recover any gain, personal profit or advantage to which such Indemnified Person is not legally entitled. Advance of legal fees 163. Expenses incurred in defTerminationing any civil or criminal action or proceeding for which indemnification is required pursuant to these Articles shall be paid by the Company in advance of the final disposition of such action or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnified Person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that the Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified pursuant to these Articles. Each Member of the Company shall be deemed to have acknowledged and agreed that the advances of funds may be made by the Company as aforesaid, and when made by the Company under this Article are made to meet expTerminationitures incurred for the purpose of enabling such Indemnified Person to properly perform his or her duties to the Company. 37 CONTINUATION 164. The Company shall have the power, subject to the provisions of the Law and with the approval of a Special Resolution, to continue as a body incorporated under the laws of any jurisdiction outside of the Cayman Islands and to be de-registered in the Cayman Islands. AMTerminationMENT OF MEMORANDUM AND ARTICLES Subject to the provisions of the Law, the Company may from time to time by Special Resolution alter or amTermination the Memorandum or these Articles in whole or in part provided that no such amTerminationment shall affect the special rights attaching to any class of Shares without the consent or sanction provided for in these Articles. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Memorandum or in these Articles or in Law, for so long as HLNG is a Member, the Company shall not alter or amTermination the Memorandum or these Articles in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of HLNG 38 SCHEDULE A INSURANCE POLICIES Hull & Material Adverse Effecthinery insurance: All insurances carried, or to be carried, by the owner of the Vessel are placed as part of Höegh LNG’s fleet placements in the international insurance markets.

The Directors may fix in advance a date as the record date to determine the Members entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of the Members and, for the purpose of determining the Members entitled to receive payment of any dividTermination, the Directors may, at or within 90 days prior to the date of the declaration of such dividTermination, fix a subsequent date as the record date for such determination. No fixed record date 11. If no such record date is fixed, the record date shall be the date on which notice of the meeting is sent or the date on which the resolution of the Directors declaring such dividTermination is adopted, as the case may be. A determination of Members entitled to vote at any meeting of Members in accordance with this Article, shall apply to any adjournment thereof. SHARE CERTIFICATES Issue of Share Certificates 12. Every Member shall be entitled, without payment, to a certificate of the Company specifying the Share or Shares held by him and the amount paid up thereon. 13. Notwithstanding the provisions of these Articles, the Directors may resolve not to issue share certificates to Members of the Company. Certificates for jointly-held Shares 14. The Company shall not be bound to issue more than one certificate for Shares held jointly by more than one person, and delivery of a certificate to one joint holder shall be sufficient delivery to all. Replacement Share Certificates 15. If a share certificate is defaced, lost or destroyed, it may be replaced on payment of such fee (if any) and on such terms (if any) as to evidence and Indemnification, and on the payment of expenses of the Company in investigating such evidence and preparing such Indemnification as the Directors shall think fit and, in case of defacement, on delivery of the old certificate to the Company for cancellation. 6 Assignment OF SHARES Instrument of Assignment 16. The instrument of Assignment of any Share shall be executed by or on behalf of the Assignmentor (and, if the Directors so determine, the Assignmentee). The Assignmentor shall be deemed to remain the holder of the Share until the name of the Assignmentee is entered in the Register of Members in respect of such Share. All instruments of Assignment, once registered, may be retained by the Company. 17. Subject to any applicable restrictions contained in these Articles, Shares shall be Assignmentred in any usual or common form approved by the Directors. Refusal to register Assignments 18. The Directors may, in their absolute discretion and without assigning any reason therefore, decline to register any Assignment of any Share. The Directors may require reasonable evidence to show the right of the Assignmentor to make the Assignment. 19. If the Directors decline to register a Assignment of Shares they shall sTermination notice of the refusal to the Assignmentee within one month after the date on which the Assignment was lodged with the Company. 20. The Directors may also suspTermination the registration of the Assignments at such times and for such periods as the Directors may from time to time determine. TRANSMISSION OF SHARES Transmission of Shares 21. If a Member dies, the survivor or survivors (where he was a joint holder), and the legal personal representative (where he was sole holder), shall be the only person recognised by the Company as having any title to the Share. The estate of a deceased Member is not thereby released from any liability in respect of any Share held by him, whether solely or jointly. For the purpose of this Article, legal personal representative means the person to whom probate or letters of administration has or have been granted in the Cayman Islands or, if there is no such person, such other person as the Directors may in their absolute discretion determine to be the person recognised by the Company for the purpose of this Article. Election by persons entitled on transmission 22. Any person becoming entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a Member or otherwise by operation of Governing Law may elect, upon such evidence being produced as may be required by the Directors as to his entitlement, either be registered himself as a Member in respect of the Share or, instead of being registered himself, to make such Assignment of the Share as the deceased or bankrupt Member could have made. 7 Manner of election 23. If the person so becoming entitled elects to be registered himself, he shall deliver or sTermination to the Company a notice in writing signed by him stating that he so elects. If he shall elect to Assignment the Shares, he shall signify his election by signing an instrument of Assignment of such Shares in favour of his Assignmentee. All the limitations, restrictions and provisions of these Articles relating to the right to Assignment and the registration of Assignments of Shares shall be applicable to any such notice or instrument of Assignment as aforesaid as if the death of the Member or other event giving rise to the transmission had not occurred and the notice or instrument of Assignment was an instrument of Assignment signed by such Member. Rights of persons entitled on transmission 24. A person becoming entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of the Member (or otherwise by operation of Governing Law), upon such evidence being produced as may be required by the Directors as to his entitlement, shall be entitled to the same dividTerminations and other monies payable in respect of the Share as he would be entitled if he were the holder of such Share. However, he shall not be entitled, until he becomes registered as the holder of such Share, to receive notices of or to attTermination or vote at general meetings of the Company or (except as aforesaid) to exercise any other rights or privileges of a Member. The Directors may at any time give notice requiring such person to elect either to be registered himself or to Assignment the Share and, if the notice is not complied with within sixty days, the Directors may thereafter withhold payment of all dividTerminations and other monies payable in respect of the Shares until the requirements of the notice have been complied with. REDEMPTION AND PURCHASE OF SHARES 25. Subject to the provisions of the Law and the Memorandum, the Company may: 25.1 purchase its own Shares (including any redeemable Shares) in such manner and on such terms as the Directors may agree with the relevant Member unless following such purchase there would no longer be any issued Shares and may make payment for such purchase or for any redemption of Shares in any manner authorised by the Law, including out of capital; and 25.2 reduce its share capital and any capital redemption reserve fund in any manner whatsoever. 8 VARIATION OF SHARE RIGHTS Variation of class rights 26. If at any time the share capital is divided into different classes of Shares, all or any of the special rights attached to any class of Shares (unless otherwise provided by the terms of issue of the Shares of that class) may be varied or abrogated with the consent in writing of the holders of not less than two thirds of the issued Shares of that class or with the sanction of a resolution passed by the holders of not less than two thirds of the issued Shares of that class as may be present in person or by proxy at a separate general meeting of the holders of the Shares of that class. To any such separate general meeting, all of the provisions of these Articles relating to general meetings shall mutatis mutandis apply, but so that the necessary quorum shall be any one or more persons holding or representing by proxy not less than one third of the issued Shares of the class and that any holder of Shares of the relevant class present in person or by proxy may demand a poll. Treatment of classes 27. For the purpose of a separate class meeting, the Directors may treat two or more of all classes of Shares as forming one class if they consider that such class of Shares would be affected in the same way by the proposals under consideration. Effect of Share issue on class rights 28. The rights conferred upon the holders of any Shares shall not, unless otherwise expressly provided in the rights attaching to such Shares, be deemed to be altered by the creation or issue of further Shares ranking pari passu therewith. NON-RECOGNITION OF TRUSTS 29. Except as required by the Law or these Articles, or under an order of a court of competent jurisdiction, the Company shall not be bound by or compelled to recognise in any way, even when notice thereof is given to it, any equitable, contingent, future or partial interest in any Share, or any other rights in respect of any Share other than an absolute right to the entirety thereof in the registered holder. 9 LIEN Lien generally 30. The Company shall have a first and paramount lien on every Share (not being a fully paid Share) for all moneys (whether presently payable or not) called or payable at a date fixed by or in accordance with the terms of issue of such Share in respect of that Share, and the Company shall also have a first and paramount lien on every Share (other than a fully paid up Share) standing registered in the name of a Member, whether singly or jointly with any other person for all debts and liabilities of a Member or his estate to the Company, whether the same shall have been incurred before or after notice to the Company of any interest of any person other than such Member, and whether the time for the payment or discharge of the same shall have actually arrived or not, and notwithstanding that the same are joint debts or liabilities of such Member or his estate and any other person, whether a Member or not. The Directors may at any time, either generally or in any particular case, waive any lien that has arisen or declare any Share to be wholly or in part exempt from the provisions of this Article. The Company's lien, if any, on a Share shall extTermination to all dividTerminations payable thereon. Enforcement 31. The Company may sell, in such manner as the Directors think fit, any Share on which the Company has a lien, provided a sum in respect of which the lien exists is presently payable, and is not paid within fourteen days after a notice in writing has been given to the registered holder  for the time being of the Share, demanding payment of the sum presently payable and giving notice of the intention to sell in default of such payment. Completion of sale 32. For giving effect to any such sale, the Directors may authorise any person to Assignment the Share sold to the purchaser thereof. The purchaser shall be registered as the holder of the Share comprised in any such Assignment and he shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money, nor shall his title to the Share be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings relating to the sale. Application of proceeds 33. The net proceeds of such sale shall be applied in payment or discharge of the debt or liability in respect of which the lien exists and as is presently payable, and any balance shall (subject to a like lien for debts or liabilities not presently payable as existed upon the Shares prior to the sale) be paid to the person who was the registered holder of the Share immediately before such sale. CALLS ON SHARES Calls on Shares generally 34. The Directors may from time to time make calls upon the Members in respect of any moneys unpaid on their Shares (whether in respect of the par value of the Shares or premium or otherwise and not, by the terms of issue thereof, made payable at a future date fixed by or in accordance with such terms of issue); and each Member shall (subject to the Company serving upon him at least 14 days’ notice specifying the time or times and place of payment) pay to the Company at the time or times and place so specified the amount called on his Shares. A call may be revoked or postponed by the Directors wholly or in part as the Directors may determine. A call shall be deemed to have been made at the time when the resolution of the Directors authorising the call was passed. 10 Payment 35. Payment of a call may be made by instalments on the direction of the Directors. 36. If a sum called in respect of a Share is not paid before or on the day appointed for payment thereof, the person from whom the sum is due shall pay interest on the sum from the day payment is due to the time of the actual payment at such rate as the Directors may determine, but the Directors may waive payment of such interest wholly or in part. 37. Any sum payable in respect of a Share on issue or allotment or at any fixed date, whether in respect of the par value of the Share or premium or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a call and if it is not paid all the relevant provisions as to payment of interest, forfeiture or otherwise of these Articles shall apply as if such sum had become due and payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified. 38. The Directors may issue Shares with different terms as to the amount and times of payment of calls. Liability of joint holders 39. The joint holders of a Share shall be jointly and severally liable to pay calls in respect thereof. Interest 40. The Directors may, if they think fit, receive from any Member willing to advance the same, all or any part of the moneys uncalled and unpaid upon any Shares held by him; and may (until the amount would otherwise become payable) pay interest at such rate (not exceeding six per cent without the sanction of the Company in general meeting) as may be agreed upon between the Member paying the sum in advance and the Directors. FORFEITURE OF SHARES Notice 41. If a Member fails to pay any call or instalment of a call by the date it becomes due and payable, the Directors may, at any time thereafter while such call or instalment remains unpaid, give notice to the Member requiring payment of the unpaid portion of the call or instalment, together with any accrued interest and expenses incurred by the Company by reason of such non-payment. 11 42. The notice shall specify where and by what date (not being less than the Termination of 14 days’ from the date of the notice) payment is to be made and shall state that if it is not complied with the Shares in respect of which the call was made will be liable to be forfeited. The Directors may accept the surrTerminationer of any Share liable to be forfeited hereunder and, in such case, references to these Articles to forfeiture shall include surrTerminationer. Forfeiture for non-compliance 43. If such notice is not complied with, any Share in respect of which the notice was given may thereafter, before the payment of all calls or instalments and interest due in respect thereof has been made, be forfeited by a resolution of the Directors. Such forfeiture shall include all dividTerminations declared, other distributions or other monies payable in respect of the forfeited Shares and not paid before the forfeiture. Forfeited Shares 44. A forfeited Share may be sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed of upon such terms and in such manner as the Directors shall think fit, and at any time before a sale, re-allotment or disposition, the forfeiture may be cancelled on such terms as the Directors think fit. Continued liability for forfeited Member 45. A person whose Shares have been forfeited shall cease to be a Member in respect of the forfeited Shares, but shall remain liable to pay to the Company all moneys which at the date of forfeiture were presently payable by him in respect of the Shares together with interest at such rate as the Directors may determine from the date of forfeiture until payment, but his liability shall cease if and when the Company receives payment in full of all amounts due in respect of the Shares. The Company may enforce payment without being under any obligation to make any allowance for the value of the Shares forfeited. Evidence of forfeiture 46. An affidavit in writing by a Director or Secretary of the Company that a Share has been duly forfeited on a specified date, shall be conclusive evidence of the facts stated in it as against all persons claiming to be entitled to the Share. The Company may receive the consideration, if any, given for the Share on any sale, re-allotment or disposition thereof and may authorise some person to execute a Assignment of the Share in favour of the person to whom the Share is sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed of, and he shall thereupon be registered as the holder of the Share, and shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money (if any) nor shall his title to the Share be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings in reference to the forfeiture, sale, re-allotment or disposition of the Share. 12 47. The provisions of these Articles as to forfeiture shall apply in the case of non-payment of any sum which, by the terms of issue of a Share, becomes payable at a fixed time, whether on account of the par value of the Share, or by way of premium or otherwise, as if the same had been made payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified to the Member. INCREASE OF CAPITAL 48. The Company may from time to time by Ordinary Resolution increase its share capital by such sum, to be divided into new Shares of such par value, and with such rights, priorities and privileges attached thereto as the resolution shall prescribe. 49. Subject to any directions given by the Company in a general meeting, all new Shares shall be at the disposal of the Directors in accordance with these Articles. 50. The new Shares shall be subject to the same provisions of these Articles with reference to the payment of calls, lien, forfeiture, Assignment, transmission and otherwise, as the Shares in the original share capital. ALTERATION OF CAPITAL 51. The Company may from time to time by Ordinary Resolution: 51.1 consolidate and divide all or any of its share capital into Shares of larger par value than its existing Shares; 51.2 sub divide its existing Shares, or any of them, into Shares of smaller par value than is fixed by the Memorandum, subject nevertheless to the provisions of section 13 of the Law; 51.3 cancel any Shares which, at the date of the passing of the resolution, have not been taken or agreed to be taken by any person; and 51.4 convert all or any paid up Shares into stock, and reconvert all or any stock into paid up Shares of any denomination. 52. The Company may from time to time by Special Resolution: 52.1 divide its Shares into several classes and attach to such classes any preferential, deferred, or special rights or restrictions in accordance with these Articles; 52.2 change the currency denomination of its share capital; 13 52.3 reduce its share capital and any capital redemption reserve fund in any manner whatsoever; and 52.4 merge or consolidate with any one or more constituent companies (as defined in the Law). GENERAL MEETINGS Convening a meeting 53. The Directors may, whenever they think fit, convene an extraordinary general meeting. If at any time there are not sufficient Directors capable of acting to form a quorum, any Director, or any one or more Members holding in the aggregate not less than one third of the total issued share capital of the Company entitled to vote, may convene an extraordinary general meeting in the same manner as nearly as possible as that in which meetings may be convened by the Directors. Members’ requisition 54.

The demand for a poll may be withdrawn by the person or any persons making it at any time prior to the declaration of the result of the poll. 68. If a poll is duly demanded, it shall be taken in such manner as the chairman directs, and the result of the poll shall be deemed to be the resolution of the meeting at which the poll was demanded. 69.

In accordance with the Law, the Company may execute any deed or other instrument (which would otherwise be required to be executed under Seal) by the signature of such deed or instrument as a deed by a Director or by the Secretary of the Company or by such other person as the Directors may appoint or by any other person or attorney on behalf of the Company appointed by a deed or other instrument executed as a deed by a Director or the Secretary or such other person as aforesaid. DIVIDTerminationS Payment of DividTerminations 134. The Directors may from time to time declare dividTerminations to be paid to the Members according to their rights and interests, including such interim dividTerminations as appear to the Directors to be justified by the position of the Company. The Directors may also pay any fixed cash dividTermination which is payable on any Shares of the Company half yearly or on such other dates, whenever the position of the Company, in the opinion of the Directors, justifies such payment. 135. No dividTermination shall be paid otherwise than out of profits or out of monies otherwise available for dividTermination in accordance with the Law. Calculation of DividTerminations 136. Subject to the rights of Members, if any, entitled to Shares with special rights as to dividTerminations, all dividTerminations shall be declared and paid according to the amount paid up on the Shares in respect of which the dividTermination is paid and any dividTermination on any class of Shares not fully paid shall be declared and paid according to the amounts paid on the Shares of that class, but if and so long as nothing is paid up on any of the Shares in the Company, dividTerminations may be declared and paid according to the number of Shares. No amount paid on a Share in advance of calls shall, while carrying interest, be treated for the purposes of this Article as paid on the Share. DividTerminations may be apportioned and paid pro rata according to the amounts paid-up on the Shares during any portion or portions of the period in respect of which the dividTermination is paid. 31 Deductions 137. The Directors may deduct from any dividTermination, distribution or other monies payable to a Member by the Company on or in respect of any Shares all sums of money (if any) presently payable by him to the Company on account of calls or otherwise in respect of Shares of the Company. Joint Holders 138. If several persons are registered as joint holders of any Share, any of them may give effectual receipts for any dividTermination or other money payable on or in respect of the Share. Payment method 139. Any dividTermination may be paid by cheque or warrant sent through the post to the address of the Member or person entitled thereto in the Register of Members or, in the case of joint holders addressed to the holder whose name stands first in the Register of Members in respect of the Shares at his registered address as appearing on the Register of Members or to such person and such address as the Member or person entitled or such joint holders as the case may be may direct in writing. Every such cheque or warrant shall, unless the holder or joint holders may in writing direct, be made payable to the order of the person to whom it is sent or to the order of the holder or, in the case of joint holders, to the order of the holder whose name stands first in the Register of Members in respect of such Shares, and shall be sent at his or their risk and payment of the cheque or warrant by the bank on which it is drawn shall constitute a good discharge to the Company. Any one of two or more joint holders may give effectual receipts for any dividTerminations, distributions or other monies payable or property distributable in respect of the Shares held by such joint holders. Satisfaction by distribution of specific assets 140. The Directors may declare that any dividTermination or distribution is paid wholly or partly by the distribution of specific assets and, in particular, of paid up shares, debentures or debenture stock of any other company or in any one or more of such ways, and where any difficulty arises in regard to such dividTermination or distribution, the Directors may settle the same as they think expedient, and in particular may issue fractional Shares or ignore fractions altogether and may fix the value for dividTermination or distribution of such specific assets or any part thereof and may determine that cash payments shall be made to any Members upon the basis of the value so fixed in order to secure equality of distribution, and may vest any such specific assets in trustees as may seem expedient to the Directors. 32 No interest 141. No dividTermination or other distribution or other monies payable by the Company on or in respect of any Share shall bear interest against the Company. Unclaimed dividTerminations 142. All unclaimed dividTerminations or distributions may be invested or otherwise made use of by the Directors for the benefit of the Company until claimed. Any dividTermination or distribution unclaimed by a Member six years after the dividTermination or distribution payment date shall be forfeited and revert to the Company. RESERVES 143. The Directors may, before declaring any dividTermination or distribution, set aside such sums as they think proper as a reserve or reserves which shall, at the discretion of the Directors, be applicable for meeting contingencies, or for equalising dividTerminations, or for any other purpose of the Company, and pTerminationing such application may, in their discretion, be employed in the business of the Company or be invested in such manner as the Directors may from time to time think fit. The Directors may also without placing the same to reserve carry forward any sums which they think it prudent not to distribute. CAPITALISATION OF PROFITS Capitalisation 144. The Directors may capitalise any sum standing to the credit of any of the Company’s reserve accounts which are available for distribution (including its Share Premium Account and capital redemption reserve fund, subject to the Law) or any sum standing to the credit of the profit and loss account or otherwise available for distribution and to appropriate such sums to Members in the proportions in which such sum would have been divisible amongst them had the same been a distribution of profits by way of dividTermination and to apply such sum on their behalf in paying up in full unissued Shares for allotment and distribution credited as fully paid-up to and amongst them in the proportion aforesaid. Authorisation 145. Where any difficulty arises in regard to any distribution under the last preceding Article, the Directors may settle the same as they think expedient and, in particular, may authorise any person to sell and Assignment any fractions or may resolve that the distribution should be as nearly as may be practicable in the correct proportion but not exactly so or may ignore fractions altogether, and may determine that cash payments should be made to any Members in order to adjust the rights of all parties, as may seem expedient to the Directors. The Directors may appoint any person to sign on behalf of the persons entitled to participate in the distribution any contract necessary or desirable for giving effect thereto and such appointment shall be effective and binding upon the Members. 33 SHARE PREMIUM ACCOUNT 146. The Directors shall in accordance with the Law establish a Share Premium Account and shall carry to the credit of such account from time to time a sum equal to the amount or value of the premium paid on the issue of any Share. 147. There shall be debited to any Share Premium Account on the redemption or purchase of a Share the difference between the nominal value of such Share and the redemption or purchase price provided always that at the discretion of the Directors such sum may be paid out of the profits of the Company or, if permitted by the Law, out of capital. ACCOUNTING RECORDS Books of account 148. The Directors shall cause to be kept accounting records sufficient to give a true and fair view of the state of the Company's affairs and to show and explain its transactions and otherwise in accordance with the Law. Inspection by Members 149. The accounting records shall be kept at the Registered Office or at such other place or places as the Directors think fit, and shall at all times be open to inspection by the Directors. No Member (who is not also a Director) shall have any right to inspect any accounting record or book or document of the Company except as conferred by law or authorised by the Directors or by the Members by Ordinary Resolution. Records and audit 150. From time to time the Company in general meeting may determine (or revoke, alter or amTermination any such determination) or, failing such determination, the Directors may determine (or revoke, alter or amTermination any such determination): 150.1 that the accounts of the Company be audited and the appointment of the Auditors; 150.2 that there be prepared and sent to each Member and other person entitled thereto a profit and loss account, a balance sheet, group accounts and/or reports for such period and on such terms as they may determine; and 150.3 that there be laid before the Company in general meeting a copy of every balance sheet together with a copy of the Auditor's report. 34 SERVICE OF NOTICES AND DOCUMENTS Form and delivery of notices 151. Notices or other documents or communications may be given to any Member by the Company either personally or by sTerminationing it by courier, post, fax or email to him to his registered address, or (if he has no registered address) to the address, if any, supplied by him to the Company for the giving of notices to him. Any notice shall be deemed to be effected: 151.1 if delivered personally or sent by courier, by properly addressing and prepaying a letter containing the notice; and to have been effected, in the case of a notice of a meeting, when delivered; 151.2 if sent by post, by properly addressing, prepaying, and posting a letter containing the notice (by airmail if available) and to have been effected, in the case of a notice of a meeting, at the Termination of three days after it was posted; and 151.3 if sent by fax or email by properly addressing and sTerminationing such notice through the appropriate transmitting medium and to have been effected on the day the same is sent. 152. A notice may be given by the Company to the joint holders of a Share by giving the notice to the joint holder named first in the Register of Members in respect of the Share. 153. A notice may be given by the Company to the person entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a Member by sTerminationing it through the post in a prepaid letter addressed to them by name, or by the title of representatives of the deceased, or trustee of the bankrupt, or by any like description, at the address, if any, supplied for the purpose by the persons claiming to be so entitled, or (until such an address has been so supplied) by giving the notice in any manner in which the same might have been given if the death or bankruptcy had not occurred. 154. Notice of every general meeting shall be given in any manner hereinbefore authorised to: 154.1 every Member entitled to vote except those Members entitled to vote who (having no registered address) have not supplied to the Company an address for the giving of notices to them; and 154.2 every person entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a Member, who, but for his death or bankruptcy would be entitled to receive notice of the meeting. 155. No other persons shall be entitled to receive notices of general meeting. 35 WINDING UP Method of winding up 156. Subject to the rights attaching to any Shares, if the Company shall be wound up, the liquidator may, with the sanction of a Special Resolution and any other sanction required by the Law or these Articles, divide amongst the Members in kind the whole or any part of the assets of the Company (whether they shall consist of property of the same kind or not) and may for such purpose set such value as he deems fair upon any property to be divided as aforesaid and may determine how such division shall be carried out as between the Members or different classes of Members. The liquidator may, with the like sanction, vest the whole or any part of such assets in trustees upon such trusts for the benefit of the contributories as the liquidator, with the like sanction, shall think fit, but so that no Member shall be compelled to accept any asset upon which there is any liability. Distribution of assets 157. If the Company shall be wound up and the assets available for distribution amongst the Members as such shall be insufficient to repay the whole of the paid up capital, such assets shall be distributed so that, as nearly as may be, the losses shall be borne by the Members in proportion to the capital paid up, or which ought to have been paid up, at the commencement of the winding up, on the Shares held by them respectively. And if in a winding up the assets available for distribution amongst the Members shall be more than sufficient to repay the whole of the capital paid up at the commencement of the winding up, the excess shall be distributed amongst the Members in proportion to the capital paid up at the commencement of the winding up on the Shares held by them respectively. This Article is to be without prejudice to the rights of the holders of Shares issued upon special terms and conditions. Indemnification Indemnification and limitation of liability 158. Every Indemnified Person shall, in the absence of wilful neglect or default, be indemnified and held harmless out of the assets of the Company against all liabilities, loss, damage, cost or expense (including but not limited to liabilities under contract, tort and statute or any applicable foreign law or regulation and all reasonable legal and other costs and expenses on a full Indemnification basis properly payable) incurred or suffered by him by or by reason of any act done, conceived in or omitted in the conduct of the Company’s business or in the discharge of his duties and the Indemnification contained in this Article shall extTermination to any Indemnified Person acting in any office or trust in the reasonable belief that he has been appointed or elected to such office or trust notwithstanding any defect in such appointment or election. 36 159. No Indemnified Person shall be liable to the Company for acts, defaults or omissions of any other Indemnified Person. Indemnification and reimbursement 160. Every Indemnified Person shall be indemnified out of the funds of the Company against all liabilities incurred by him by or by reason of any act done, conceived in or omitted in the conduct of the Company’s business or in the discharge of his duties in defTerminationing any proceedings, whether civil or criminal, in which judgment is given in his favour, or in which he is acquitted, or in connection with any application in which relief from liability is granted to him by the court. 161. To the extent that any Indemnified Person is entitled to claim an Indemnification pursuant to these Articles in respect of amounts paid or discharged by him, the relative Indemnification shall take effect as an obligation of the Company to reimburse the person making such payment or effecting such discharge. Wilful neglect or default 162. Each Member and the Company agree to waive any claim or right of action he or it may at any time have, whether individually or by or in the right of the Company, against any Indemnified Person on account of any act or omission of such Indemnified Person in the performance of his duties for the Company; provided however, that such waiver shall not apply to any claims or rights of action arising out of the wilful neglect or default of such Indemnified Person or to recover any gain, personal profit or advantage to which such Indemnified Person is not legally entitled. Advance of legal fees 163. Expenses incurred in defTerminationing any civil or criminal action or proceeding for which indemnification is required pursuant to these Articles shall be paid by the Company in advance of the final disposition of such action or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnified Person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that the Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified pursuant to these Articles. Each Member of the Company shall be deemed to have acknowledged and agreed that the advances of funds may be made by the Company as aforesaid, and when made by the Company under this Article are made to meet expTerminationitures incurred for the purpose of enabling such Indemnified Person to properly perform his or her duties to the Company. 37 CONTINUATION 164. The Company shall have the power, subject to the provisions of the Law and with the approval of a Special Resolution, to continue as a body incorporated under the laws of any jurisdiction outside of the Cayman Islands and to be de-registered in the Cayman Islands. AMTerminationMENT OF MEMORANDUM AND ARTICLES Subject to the provisions of the Law, the Company may from time to time by Special Resolution alter or amTermination the Memorandum or these Articles in whole or in part provided that no such amTerminationment shall affect the special rights attaching to any class of Shares without the consent or sanction provided for in these Articles. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Memorandum or in these Articles or in Law, for so long as HLNG is a Member, the Company shall not alter or amTermination the Memorandum or these Articles in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of HLNG 38 SCHEDULE A INSURANCE POLICIES Hull & Material Adverse Effecthinery insurance: All insurances carried, or to be carried, by the owner of the Vessel are placed as part of Höegh LNG’s fleet placements in the international insurance markets.

The Directors may fix in advance a date as the record date to determine the Members entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of the Members and, for the purpose of determining the Members entitled to receive payment of any dividTermination, the Directors may, at or within 90 days prior to the date of the declaration of such dividTermination, fix a subsequent date as the record date for such determination. No fixed record date 11. If no such record date is fixed, the record date shall be the date on which notice of the meeting is sent or the date on which the resolution of the Directors declaring such dividTermination is adopted, as the case may be.

The instrument of Assignment of any Share shall be executed by or on behalf of the Assignmentor (and, if the Directors so determine, the Assignmentee). The Assignmentor shall be deemed to remain the holder of the Share until the name of the Assignmentee is entered in the Register of Members in respect of such Share. All instruments of Assignment, once registered, may be retained by the Company. 17. Subject to any applicable restrictions contained in these Articles, Shares shall be Assignmentred in any usual or common form approved by the Directors. Refusal to register Assignments 18. The Directors may, in their absolute discretion and without assigning any reason therefore, decline to register any Assignment of any Share. The Directors may require reasonable evidence to show the right of the Assignmentor to make the Assignment. 19. If the Directors decline to register a Assignment of Shares they shall sTermination notice of the refusal to the Assignmentee within one month after the date on which the Assignment was lodged with the Company. 20. The Directors may also suspTermination the registration of the Assignments at such times and for such periods as the Directors may from time to time determine. TRANSMISSION OF SHARES Transmission of Shares 21. If a Member dies, the survivor or survivors (where he was a joint holder), and the legal personal representative (where he was sole holder), shall be the only person recognised by the Company as having any title to the Share. The estate of a deceased Member is not thereby released from any liability in respect of any Share held by him, whether solely or jointly. For the purpose of this Article, legal personal representative means the person to whom probate or letters of administration has or have been granted in the Cayman Islands or, if there is no such person, such other person as the Directors may in their absolute discretion determine to be the person recognised by the Company for the purpose of this Article. Election by persons entitled on transmission 22. Any person becoming entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a Member or otherwise by operation of Governing Law may elect, upon such evidence being produced as may be required by the Directors as to his entitlement, either be registered himself as a Member in respect of the Share or, instead of being registered himself, to make such Assignment of the Share as the deceased or bankrupt Member could have made. 7 Manner of election 23. If the person so becoming entitled elects to be registered himself, he shall deliver or sTermination to the Company a notice in writing signed by him stating that he so elects. If he shall elect to Assignment the Shares, he shall signify his election by signing an instrument of Assignment of such Shares in favour of his Assignmentee. All the limitations, restrictions and provisions of these Articles relating to the right to Assignment and the registration of Assignments of Shares shall be applicable to any such notice or instrument of Assignment as aforesaid as if the death of the Member or other event giving rise to the transmission had not occurred and the notice or instrument of Assignment was an instrument of Assignment signed by such Member. Rights of persons entitled on transmission 24. A person becoming entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of the Member (or otherwise by operation of Governing Law), upon such evidence being produced as may be required by the Directors as to his entitlement, shall be entitled to the same dividTerminations and other monies payable in respect of the Share as he would be entitled if he were the holder of such Share. However, he shall not be entitled, until he becomes registered as the holder of such Share, to receive notices of or to attTermination or vote at general meetings of the Company or (except as aforesaid) to exercise any other rights or privileges of a Member. The Directors may at any time give notice requiring such person to elect either to be registered himself or to Assignment the Share and, if the notice is not complied with within sixty days, the Directors may thereafter withhold payment of all dividTerminations and other monies payable in respect of the Shares until the requirements of the notice have been complied with. REDEMPTION AND PURCHASE OF SHARES 25. Subject to the provisions of the Law and the Memorandum, the Company may: 25.1 purchase its own Shares (including any redeemable Shares) in such manner and on such terms as the Directors may agree with the relevant Member unless following such purchase there would no longer be any issued Shares and may make payment for such purchase or for any redemption of Shares in any manner authorised by the Law, including out of capital; and 25.2 reduce its share capital and any capital redemption reserve fund in any manner whatsoever. 8 VARIATION OF SHARE RIGHTS Variation of class rights 26. If at any time the share capital is divided into different classes of Shares, all or any of the special rights attached to any class of Shares (unless otherwise provided by the terms of issue of the Shares of that class) may be varied or abrogated with the consent in writing of the holders of not less than two thirds of the issued Shares of that class or with the sanction of a resolution passed by the holders of not less than two thirds of the issued Shares of that class as may be present in person or by proxy at a separate general meeting of the holders of the Shares of that class. To any such separate general meeting, all of the provisions of these Articles relating to general meetings shall mutatis mutandis apply, but so that the necessary quorum shall be any one or more persons holding or representing by proxy not less than one third of the issued Shares of the class and that any holder of Shares of the relevant class present in person or by proxy may demand a poll. Treatment of classes 27. For the purpose of a separate class meeting, the Directors may treat two or more of all classes of Shares as forming one class if they consider that such class of Shares would be affected in the same way by the proposals under consideration. Effect of Share issue on class rights 28. The rights conferred upon the holders of any Shares shall not, unless otherwise expressly provided in the rights attaching to such Shares, be deemed to be altered by the creation or issue of further Shares ranking pari passu therewith. NON-RECOGNITION OF TRUSTS 29. Except as required by the Law or these Articles, or under an order of a court of competent jurisdiction, the Company shall not be bound by or compelled to recognise in any way, even when notice thereof is given to it, any equitable, contingent, future or partial interest in any Share, or any other rights in respect of any Share other than an absolute right to the entirety thereof in the registered holder. 9 LIEN Lien generally 30. The Company shall have a first and paramount lien on every Share (not being a fully paid Share) for all moneys (whether presently payable or not) called or payable at a date fixed by or in accordance with the terms of issue of such Share in respect of that Share, and the Company shall also have a first and paramount lien on every Share (other than a fully paid up Share) standing registered in the name of a Member, whether singly or jointly with any other person for all debts and liabilities of a Member or his estate to the Company, whether the same shall have been incurred before or after notice to the Company of any interest of any person other than such Member, and whether the time for the payment or discharge of the same shall have actually arrived or not, and notwithstanding that the same are joint debts or liabilities of such Member or his estate and any other person, whether a Member or not. The Directors may at any time, either generally or in any particular case, waive any lien that has arisen or declare any Share to be wholly or in part exempt from the provisions of this Article. The Company's lien, if any, on a Share shall extTermination to all dividTerminations payable thereon. Enforcement 31. The Company may sell, in such manner as the Directors think fit, any Share on which the Company has a lien, provided a sum in respect of which the lien exists is presently payable, and is not paid within fourteen days after a notice in writing has been given to the registered holder  for the time being of the Share, demanding payment of the sum presently payable and giving notice of the intention to sell in default of such payment. Completion of sale 32. For giving effect to any such sale, the Directors may authorise any person to Assignment the Share sold to the purchaser thereof. The purchaser shall be registered as the holder of the Share comprised in any such Assignment and he shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money, nor shall his title to the Share be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings relating to the sale. Application of proceeds 33. The net proceeds of such sale shall be applied in payment or discharge of the debt or liability in respect of which the lien exists and as is presently payable, and any balance shall (subject to a like lien for debts or liabilities not presently payable as existed upon the Shares prior to the sale) be paid to the person who was the registered holder of the Share immediately before such sale. CALLS ON SHARES Calls on Shares generally 34. The Directors may from time to time make calls upon the Members in respect of any moneys unpaid on their Shares (whether in respect of the par value of the Shares or premium or otherwise and not, by the terms of issue thereof, made payable at a future date fixed by or in accordance with such terms of issue); and each Member shall (subject to the Company serving upon him at least 14 days’ notice specifying the time or times and place of payment) pay to the Company at the time or times and place so specified the amount called on his Shares. A call may be revoked or postponed by the Directors wholly or in part as the Directors may determine. A call shall be deemed to have been made at the time when the resolution of the Directors authorising the call was passed. 10 Payment 35. Payment of a call may be made by instalments on the direction of the Directors. 36. If a sum called in respect of a Share is not paid before or on the day appointed for payment thereof, the person from whom the sum is due shall pay interest on the sum from the day payment is due to the time of the actual payment at such rate as the Directors may determine, but the Directors may waive payment of such interest wholly or in part. 37. Any sum payable in respect of a Share on issue or allotment or at any fixed date, whether in respect of the par value of the Share or premium or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a call and if it is not paid all the relevant provisions as to payment of interest, forfeiture or otherwise of these Articles shall apply as if such sum had become due and payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified. 38. The Directors may issue Shares with different terms as to the amount and times of payment of calls. Liability of joint holders 39. The joint holders of a Share shall be jointly and severally liable to pay calls in respect thereof. Interest 40. The Directors may, if they think fit, receive from any Member willing to advance the same, all or any part of the moneys uncalled and unpaid upon any Shares held by him; and may (until the amount would otherwise become payable) pay interest at such rate (not exceeding six per cent without the sanction of the Company in general meeting) as may be agreed upon between the Member paying the sum in advance and the Directors. FORFEITURE OF SHARES Notice 41. If a Member fails to pay any call or instalment of a call by the date it becomes due and payable, the Directors may, at any time thereafter while such call or instalment remains unpaid, give notice to the Member requiring payment of the unpaid portion of the call or instalment, together with any accrued interest and expenses incurred by the Company by reason of such non-payment. 11 42. The notice shall specify where and by what date (not being less than the Termination of 14 days’ from the date of the notice) payment is to be made and shall state that if it is not complied with the Shares in respect of which the call was made will be liable to be forfeited. The Directors may accept the surrTerminationer of any Share liable to be forfeited hereunder and, in such case, references to these Articles to forfeiture shall include surrTerminationer. Forfeiture for non-compliance 43. If such notice is not complied with, any Share in respect of which the notice was given may thereafter, before the payment of all calls or instalments and interest due in respect thereof has been made, be forfeited by a resolution of the Directors. Such forfeiture shall include all dividTerminations declared, other distributions or other monies payable in respect of the forfeited Shares and not paid before the forfeiture. Forfeited Shares 44. A forfeited Share may be sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed of upon such terms and in such manner as the Directors shall think fit, and at any time before a sale, re-allotment or disposition, the forfeiture may be cancelled on such terms as the Directors think fit. Continued liability for forfeited Member 45. A person whose Shares have been forfeited shall cease to be a Member in respect of the forfeited Shares, but shall remain liable to pay to the Company all moneys which at the date of forfeiture were presently payable by him in respect of the Shares together with interest at such rate as the Directors may determine from the date of forfeiture until payment, but his liability shall cease if and when the Company receives payment in full of all amounts due in respect of the Shares. The Company may enforce payment without being under any obligation to make any allowance for the value of the Shares forfeited. Evidence of forfeiture 46. An affidavit in writing by a Director or Secretary of the Company that a Share has been duly forfeited on a specified date, shall be conclusive evidence of the facts stated in it as against all persons claiming to be entitled to the Share. The Company may receive the consideration, if any, given for the Share on any sale, re-allotment or disposition thereof and may authorise some person to execute a Assignment of the Share in favour of the person to whom the Share is sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed of, and he shall thereupon be registered as the holder of the Share, and shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money (if any) nor shall his title to the Share be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings in reference to the forfeiture, sale, re-allotment or disposition of the Share. 12 47. The provisions of these Articles as to forfeiture shall apply in the case of non-payment of any sum which, by the terms of issue of a Share, becomes payable at a fixed time, whether on account of the par value of the Share, or by way of premium or otherwise, as if the same had been made payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified to the Member. INCREASE OF CAPITAL 48. The Company may from time to time by Ordinary Resolution increase its share capital by such sum, to be divided into new Shares of such par value, and with such rights, priorities and privileges attached thereto as the resolution shall prescribe. 49. Subject to any directions given by the Company in a general meeting, all new Shares shall be at the disposal of the Directors in accordance with these Articles. 50. The new Shares shall be subject to the same provisions of these Articles with reference to the payment of calls, lien, forfeiture, Assignment, transmission and otherwise, as the Shares in the original share capital. ALTERATION OF CAPITAL 51. The Company may from time to time by Ordinary Resolution: 51.1 consolidate and divide all or any of its share capital into Shares of larger par value than its existing Shares; 51.2 sub divide its existing Shares, or any of them, into Shares of smaller par value than is fixed by the Memorandum, subject nevertheless to the provisions of section 13 of the Law; 51.3 cancel any Shares which, at the date of the passing of the resolution, have not been taken or agreed to be taken by any person; and 51.4 convert all or any paid up Shares into stock, and reconvert all or any stock into paid up Shares of any denomination. 52. The Company may from time to time by Special Resolution: 52.1 divide its Shares into several classes and attach to such classes any preferential, deferred, or special rights or restrictions in accordance with these Articles; 52.2 change the currency denomination of its share capital; 13 52.3 reduce its share capital and any capital redemption reserve fund in any manner whatsoever; and 52.4 merge or consolidate with any one or more constituent companies (as defined in the Law). GENERAL MEETINGS Convening a meeting 53. The Directors may, whenever they think fit, convene an extraordinary general meeting. If at any time there are not sufficient Directors capable of acting to form a quorum, any Director, or any one or more Members holding in the aggregate not less than one third of the total issued share capital of the Company entitled to vote, may convene an extraordinary general meeting in the same manner as nearly as possible as that in which meetings may be convened by the Directors. Members’ requisition 54. The Directors shall, upon the requisition in writing of one or more Members holding in the aggregate not less than one tenth of such paid up capital of the Company as at the date of the requisition carries the right of voting at general meetings, convene an extraordinary general meeting. Any such requisition shall express the object of the meeting proposed to be called, and must be signed by the requisitionists and deposited at the Registered Office, and may consist of several documents in like form, each signed by one or more requisitionists. 55. If there are no Directors as at the date of the deposit of the Members’ requisition or if the Directors do not convene a general meeting within 21 days from the date of the deposit, the requisitionists or any or any of them or any other Member or Members holding in the aggregate not less than one tenth of such paid up capital of the Company as at the date of the requisition, may convene an extraordinary general meeting. A general meeting convened by requisitionists shall be convened in the same manner as nearly as possible as that in which general meetings are to be convened by the Directors. NOTICE OF GENERAL MEETINGS Length and form of notice 56. At least five clear days’ notice shall be given of any general meeting. Every notice shall specify the place, the day and the time of meeting and, in the case of special business, the general nature of the business to be conducted at the general meeting, and shall be given in the manner provided in these Articles or in such other manner (if any) as may be prescribed by the Company, to such persons as are entitled to receive such notices from the Company. A general meeting may be convened by such shorter notice, or without notice, by a majority in number of the Members having the right to attTermination and vote at the meeting, being a majority together holding not less than ninety-five percent in nominal value of the Shares giving that right. 14 Omission or non-receipt 57. The accidental omission to give notice of a meeting to, or the non-receipt of a notice of a meeting by, any Member entitled to receive notice shall not invalidate the proceedings at any meeting. PROCEEDINGS AT GENERAL MEETINGS 58. All business shall be deemed special that is transacted at an extraordinary general meeting. Quorum 59. No business shall be transacted at any general meeting unless a quorum of Members is present at the time that the meeting proceeds to business, but the absence of a quorum shall not preclude the appointment, choice or election of a chairman, which shall not be treated as part of the business of the Meeting. Save as herein otherwise provided, one or more Members holding in the aggregate not less than one third of the total issued share capital of the Company present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall be a quorum. Adjournment for lack of quorum 60. If within five minutes (or such longer time as the chairman of the meeting may determine to wait) after the time appointed for the meeting, a quorum is not present, the meeting, if convened upon the requisition of Members, shall be dissolved. In any other case, it shall stand adjourned to the same day in the next week, at the same time and place, and if at the adjourned meeting a quorum is not present within half an hour from the time appointed for the meeting, the Members present shall be a quorum. Meeting by telephone or other facilities 61. A meeting of the Members may be held by telephone, electronic or other communication facilities (including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, by telephone or video conferencing) by which all persons participating in the meeting can communicate with each other simultaneously and instantaneously, and participation in such a general meeting shall constitute presence in person at such meeting. 62. Any Director shall be entitled to attTermination and speak at any general meeting of the Company. 15 Appointment of chairman 63. The chairman (if any) of the Board of Directors shall preside as chairman at every general meeting of the Company. If there is no such chairman, or if at any meeting he is not present within five minutes after the time appointed for holding the meeting or is unwilling to act as chairman, the Directors present shall choose one of their number to act or, if only one Director is present, he shall preside as chairman if willing to act. If no Director is present, or if each of the Directors present declines to take the chair, the Members present and entitled to vote shall elect one of their number to be chairman. Adjournment of meeting 64. The chairman may, with the consent of a meeting at which a quorum is present (and shall if so directed by the meeting) adjourn the meeting from time to time and from place to place, but no business shall be transacted at any adjourned meeting other than the business left unfinished at the meeting from which the adjournment took place. When a meeting is adjourned for ten days or more, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given as in the case of an original meeting. Save as aforesaid, it shall not be necessary to give any notice of an adjournment or of the business to be transacted at an adjourned meeting. VOTING Ordinary Resolution Save where a Special Resolution or other greater majority is required by the Law or these Articles, any question proposed for consideration at any general meeting shall be decided by an Ordinary Resolution. Voting on a show of hands 65. At any general meeting, a resolution put to the vote of the meeting shall be decided on a show of hands, unless before or on the declaration of the result of the show of hands, or on the withdrawal of any other demand for a poll. Demand for poll 66. A poll is demanded by: 66.1 the chairman of the meeting; or 66.2 at least three Members present in person or by proxy; or 66.3 any Member or Members present in person or by proxy and holding collectively not less than one tenth of the total voting rights of all the Members having the right to vote at such meeting; or 16 66.4 a Member or Members present in person or by proxy holding Shares conferring the right to vote at such meeting, being Shares on which an aggregate sum has been paid up equal to not less than one tenth of the total sum paid up on all such Shares conferring such right. 67. Unless a poll is duly demanded and the demand is not withdrawn, a declaration by the chairman that a resolution has, on a show of hands, been carried or carried unanimously, or by a particular majority, or lost and an entry to that effect in the minutes of the proceedings of the Company shall be conclusive evidence of that fact, without proof of the number or proportion of the votes recorded in favour of, or against, that resolution. The demand for a poll may be withdrawn by the person or any persons making it at any time prior to the declaration of the result of the poll. 68. If a poll is duly demanded, it shall be taken in such manner as the chairman directs, and the result of the poll shall be deemed to be the resolution of the meeting at which the poll was demanded. 69. In the case of an equality of votes at a general meeting, whether on a show of hands or on a poll, the chairman of the meeting at which the show of hands takes place or at which the poll is demanded, shall not be entitled to a second or casting vote and the resolution shall fail. 70. A poll demanded on the election of a chairman or on a question of adjournment shall be taken forthwith. A poll demanded on any other question shall be taken in such manner and either forthwith or at such time later in the meeting as the chairman of the meeting shall direct. 71. The demand for a poll shall not prevent the continuance of a meeting for the transaction of any business other than the question on which the poll has been demanded and it may be withdrawn at any time before the close of the meeting or the taking of the poll, whichever is the earlier. Voting on a poll 72. On a poll votes may be cast either personally or by proxy. 73. A person entitled to more than one vote on a poll need not use all his votes or cast all the votes he uses in the same way. 74. On a show of hands, every Member present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall have one vote. On a poll, every Member present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall have one vote for each Share of which he is the registered holder. 17 75. In the case of joint holders of a Share, the vote of the senior who tTerminationers a vote, whether in person or by proxy, shall be accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint holders; and for this purpose seniority shall be determined by the order in which the names stand in the Register of Members in respect of the joint holding. 76. A Member of unsound mind, or, in respect of whom an order has been made by any court having jurisdiction in lunacy, may vote, whether on a show of hands or on a poll, by his receiver, committee, curator bonis or other person of similar nature appointed by such court, and any such receiver, committee, curator bonis or other person may vote by proxy and may otherwise act and be treated as such Member for the purpose of the general meetings. 77. No Member, unless the Directors otherwise determine, shall be entitled to vote at any general meeting, unless all calls or other sums presently payable by him in respect of Shares in the Company have been paid. 78. No objection shall be raised as to the qualification of any voter or as to whether any votes have been properly counted except at the general meeting or adjourned general meeting at which the vote objected to is given or tTerminationered and every vote not disallowed at the meeting shall be valid. Any objection made in due time and in accordance with these Articles shall be referred to the chairman whose decision shall be final and conclusive. Shareholder Restricted Matters 78A.

Such Secretary or other officers need not be Directors and in the case of the other officers may be ascribed such titles as the Directors may decide and the Directors may revoke or terminate any such election or appointment. Any such revocation or termination shall be without prejudice to any claim for any damages that such officer may have against the Company or the Company may have against such officer for any breach of any contract of service between him and the Company which may be involved in such revocation or termination.

DIVIDTerminationS Payment of DividTerminations 134. The Directors may from time to time declare dividTerminations to be paid to the Members according to their rights and interests, including such interim dividTerminations as appear to the Directors to be justified by the position of the Company. The Directors may also pay any fixed cash dividTermination which is payable on any Shares of the Company half yearly or on such other dates, whenever the position of the Company, in the opinion of the Directors, justifies such payment. 135. No dividTermination shall be paid otherwise than out of profits or out of monies otherwise available for dividTermination in accordance with the Law. Calculation of DividTerminations 136. Subject to the rights of Members, if any, entitled to Shares with special rights as to dividTerminations, all dividTerminations shall be declared and paid according to the amount paid up on the Shares in respect of which the dividTermination is paid and any dividTermination on any class of Shares not fully paid shall be declared and paid according to the amounts paid on the Shares of that class, but if and so long as nothing is paid up on any of the Shares in the Company, dividTerminations may be declared and paid according to the number of Shares. No amount paid on a Share in advance of calls shall, while carrying interest, be treated for the purposes of this Article as paid on the Share. DividTerminations may be apportioned and paid pro rata according to the amounts paid-up on the Shares during any portion or portions of the period in respect of which the dividTermination is paid. 31 Deductions 137. The Directors may deduct from any dividTermination, distribution or other monies payable to a Member by the Company on or in respect of any Shares all sums of money (if any) presently payable by him to the Company on account of calls or otherwise in respect of Shares of the Company. Joint Holders 138. If several persons are registered as joint holders of any Share, any of them may give effectual receipts for any dividTermination or other money payable on or in respect of the Share. Payment method 139. Any dividTermination may be paid by cheque or warrant sent through the post to the address of the Member or person entitled thereto in the Register of Members or, in the case of joint holders addressed to the holder whose name stands first in the Register of Members in respect of the Shares at his registered address as appearing on the Register of Members or to such person and such address as the Member or person entitled or such joint holders as the case may be may direct in writing. Every such cheque or warrant shall, unless the holder or joint holders may in writing direct, be made payable to the order of the person to whom it is sent or to the order of the holder or, in the case of joint holders, to the order of the holder whose name stands first in the Register of Members in respect of such Shares, and shall be sent at his or their risk and payment of the cheque or warrant by the bank on which it is drawn shall constitute a good discharge to the Company. Any one of two or more joint holders may give effectual receipts for any dividTerminations, distributions or other monies payable or property distributable in respect of the Shares held by such joint holders. Satisfaction by distribution of specific assets 140. The Directors may declare that any dividTermination or distribution is paid wholly or partly by the distribution of specific assets and, in particular, of paid up shares, debentures or debenture stock of any other company or in any one or more of such ways, and where any difficulty arises in regard to such dividTermination or distribution, the Directors may settle the same as they think expedient, and in particular may issue fractional Shares or ignore fractions altogether and may fix the value for dividTermination or distribution of such specific assets or any part thereof and may determine that cash payments shall be made to any Members upon the basis of the value so fixed in order to secure equality of distribution, and may vest any such specific assets in trustees as may seem expedient to the Directors. 32 No interest 141. No dividTermination or other distribution or other monies payable by the Company on or in respect of any Share shall bear interest against the Company. Unclaimed dividTerminations 142. All unclaimed dividTerminations or distributions may be invested or otherwise made use of by the Directors for the benefit of the Company until claimed. Any dividTermination or distribution unclaimed by a Member six years after the dividTermination or distribution payment date shall be forfeited and revert to the Company. RESERVES 143. The Directors may, before declaring any dividTermination or distribution, set aside such sums as they think proper as a reserve or reserves which shall, at the discretion of the Directors, be applicable for meeting contingencies, or for equalising dividTerminations, or for any other purpose of the Company, and pTerminationing such application may, in their discretion, be employed in the business of the Company or be invested in such manner as the Directors may from time to time think fit. The Directors may also without placing the same to reserve carry forward any sums which they think it prudent not to distribute. CAPITALISATION OF PROFITS Capitalisation 144. The Directors may capitalise any sum standing to the credit of any of the Company’s reserve accounts which are available for distribution (including its Share Premium Account and capital redemption reserve fund, subject to the Law) or any sum standing to the credit of the profit and loss account or otherwise available for distribution and to appropriate such sums to Members in the proportions in which such sum would have been divisible amongst them had the same been a distribution of profits by way of dividTermination and to apply such sum on their behalf in paying up in full unissued Shares for allotment and distribution credited as fully paid-up to and amongst them in the proportion aforesaid. Authorisation 145. Where any difficulty arises in regard to any distribution under the last preceding Article, the Directors may settle the same as they think expedient and, in particular, may authorise any person to sell and Assignment any fractions or may resolve that the distribution should be as nearly as may be practicable in the correct proportion but not exactly so or may ignore fractions altogether, and may determine that cash payments should be made to any Members in order to adjust the rights of all parties, as may seem expedient to the Directors. The Directors may appoint any person to sign on behalf of the persons entitled to participate in the distribution any contract necessary or desirable for giving effect thereto and such appointment shall be effective and binding upon the Members. 33 SHARE PREMIUM ACCOUNT 146. The Directors shall in accordance with the Law establish a Share Premium Account and shall carry to the credit of such account from time to time a sum equal to the amount or value of the premium paid on the issue of any Share. 147. There shall be debited to any Share Premium Account on the redemption or purchase of a Share the difference between the nominal value of such Share and the redemption or purchase price provided always that at the discretion of the Directors such sum may be paid out of the profits of the Company or, if permitted by the Law, out of capital.

Inspection by Members 149. The accounting records shall be kept at the Registered Office or at such other place or places as the Directors think fit, and shall at all times be open to inspection by the Directors.

A notice may be given by the Company to the person entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a Member by sTerminationing it through the post in a prepaid letter addressed to them by name, or by the title of representatives of the deceased, or trustee of the bankrupt, or by any like description, at the address, if any, supplied for the purpose by the persons claiming to be so entitled, or (until such an address has been so supplied) by giving the notice in any manner in which the same might have been given if the death or bankruptcy had not occurred. 154.

Subject to the rights attaching to any Shares, if the Company shall be wound up, the liquidator may, with the sanction of a Special Resolution and any other sanction required by the Law or these Articles, divide amongst the Members in kind the whole or any part of the assets of the Company (whether they shall consist of property of the same kind or not) and may for such purpose set such value as he deems fair upon any property to be divided as aforesaid and may determine how such division shall be carried out as between the Members or different classes of Members. The liquidator may, with the like sanction, vest the whole or any part of such assets in trustees upon such trusts for the benefit of the contributories as the liquidator, with the like sanction, shall think fit, but so that no Member shall be compelled to accept any asset upon which there is any liability. Distribution of assets 157. If the Company shall be wound up and the assets available for distribution amongst the Members as such shall be insufficient to repay the whole of the paid up capital, such assets shall be distributed so that, as nearly as may be, the losses shall be borne by the Members in proportion to the capital paid up, or which ought to have been paid up, at the commencement of the winding up, on the Shares held by them respectively. And if in a winding up the assets available for distribution amongst the Members shall be more than sufficient to repay the whole of the capital paid up at the commencement of the winding up, the excess shall be distributed amongst the Members in proportion to the capital paid up at the commencement of the winding up on the Shares held by them respectively. This Article is to be without prejudice to the rights of the holders of Shares issued upon special terms and conditions. Indemnification Indemnification and limitation of liability 158. Every Indemnified Person shall, in the absence of wilful neglect or default, be indemnified and held harmless out of the assets of the Company against all liabilities, loss, damage, cost or expense (including but not limited to liabilities under contract, tort and statute or any applicable foreign law or regulation and all reasonable legal and other costs and expenses on a full Indemnification basis properly payable) incurred or suffered by him by or by reason of any act done, conceived in or omitted in the conduct of the Company’s business or in the discharge of his duties and the Indemnification contained in this Article shall extTermination to any Indemnified Person acting in any office or trust in the reasonable belief that he has been appointed or elected to such office or trust notwithstanding any defect in such appointment or election. 36 159.

Every Indemnified Person shall be indemnified out of the funds of the Company against all liabilities incurred by him by or by reason of any act done, conceived in or omitted in the conduct of the Company’s business or in the discharge of his duties in defTerminationing any proceedings, whether civil or criminal, in which judgment is given in his favour, or in which he is acquitted, or in connection with any application in which relief from liability is granted to him by the court. 161. To the extent that any Indemnified Person is entitled to claim an Indemnification pursuant to these Articles in respect of amounts paid or discharged by him, the relative Indemnification shall take effect as an obligation of the Company to reimburse the person making such payment or effecting such discharge. Wilful neglect or default 162. Each Member and the Company agree to waive any claim or right of action he or it may at any time have, whether individually or by or in the right of the Company, against any Indemnified Person on account of any act or omission of such Indemnified Person in the performance of his duties for the Company; provided however, that such waiver shall not apply to any claims or rights of action arising out of the wilful neglect or default of such Indemnified Person or to recover any gain, personal profit or advantage to which such Indemnified Person is not legally entitled. Advance of legal fees 163. Expenses incurred in defTerminationing any civil or criminal action or proceeding for which indemnification is required pursuant to these Articles shall be paid by the Company in advance of the final disposition of such action or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnified Person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that the Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified pursuant to these Articles. Each Member of the Company shall be deemed to have acknowledged and agreed that the advances of funds may be made by the Company as aforesaid, and when made by the Company under this Article are made to meet expTerminationitures incurred for the purpose of enabling such Indemnified Person to properly perform his or her duties to the Company. 37 CONTINUATION 164.

If a Member dies, the survivor or survivors (where he was a joint holder), and the legal personal representative (where he was sole holder), shall be the only person recognised by the Company as having any title to the Share.

If the person so becoming entitled elects to be registered himself, he shall deliver or sTermination to the Company a notice in writing signed by him stating that he so elects. If he shall elect to Assignment the Shares, he shall signify his election by signing an instrument of Assignment of such Shares in favour of his Assignmentee. All the limitations, restrictions and provisions of these Articles relating to the right to Assignment and the registration of Assignments of Shares shall be applicable to any such notice or instrument of Assignment as aforesaid as if the death of the Member or other event giving rise to the transmission had not occurred and the notice or instrument of Assignment was an instrument of Assignment signed by such Member. Rights of persons entitled on transmission 24. A person becoming entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of the Member (or otherwise by operation of Governing Law), upon such evidence being produced as may be required by the Directors as to his entitlement, shall be entitled to the same dividTerminations and other monies payable in respect of the Share as he would be entitled if he were the holder of such Share. However, he shall not be entitled, until he becomes registered as the holder of such Share, to receive notices of or to attTermination or vote at general meetings of the Company or (except as aforesaid) to exercise any other rights or privileges of a Member. The Directors may at any time give notice requiring such person to elect either to be registered himself or to Assignment the Share and, if the notice is not complied with within sixty days, the Directors may thereafter withhold payment of all dividTerminations and other monies payable in respect of the Shares until the requirements of the notice have been complied with. REDEMPTION AND PURCHASE OF SHARES 25. Subject to the provisions of the Law and the Memorandum, the Company may: 25.1 purchase its own Shares (including any redeemable Shares) in such manner and on such terms as the Directors may agree with the relevant Member unless following such purchase there would no longer be any issued Shares and may make payment for such purchase or for any redemption of Shares in any manner authorised by the Law, including out of capital; and 25.2 reduce its share capital and any capital redemption reserve fund in any manner whatsoever. 8 VARIATION OF SHARE RIGHTS Variation of class rights 26. If at any time the share capital is divided into different classes of Shares, all or any of the special rights attached to any class of Shares (unless otherwise provided by the terms of issue of the Shares of that class) may be varied or abrogated with the consent in writing of the holders of not less than two thirds of the issued Shares of that class or with the sanction of a resolution passed by the holders of not less than two thirds of the issued Shares of that class as may be present in person or by proxy at a separate general meeting of the holders of the Shares of that class. To any such separate general meeting, all of the provisions of these Articles relating to general meetings shall mutatis mutandis apply, but so that the necessary quorum shall be any one or more persons holding or representing by proxy not less than one third of the issued Shares of the class and that any holder of Shares of the relevant class present in person or by proxy may demand a poll. Treatment of classes 27. For the purpose of a separate class meeting, the Directors may treat two or more of all classes of Shares as forming one class if they consider that such class of Shares would be affected in the same way by the proposals under consideration. Effect of Share issue on class rights 28. The rights conferred upon the holders of any Shares shall not, unless otherwise expressly provided in the rights attaching to such Shares, be deemed to be altered by the creation or issue of further Shares ranking pari passu therewith. NON-RECOGNITION OF TRUSTS 29. Except as required by the Law or these Articles, or under an order of a court of competent jurisdiction, the Company shall not be bound by or compelled to recognise in any way, even when notice thereof is given to it, any equitable, contingent, future or partial interest in any Share, or any other rights in respect of any Share other than an absolute right to the entirety thereof in the registered holder. 9 LIEN Lien generally 30. The Company shall have a first and paramount lien on every Share (not being a fully paid Share) for all moneys (whether presently payable or not) called or payable at a date fixed by or in accordance with the terms of issue of such Share in respect of that Share, and the Company shall also have a first and paramount lien on every Share (other than a fully paid up Share) standing registered in the name of a Member, whether singly or jointly with any other person for all debts and liabilities of a Member or his estate to the Company, whether the same shall have been incurred before or after notice to the Company of any interest of any person other than such Member, and whether the time for the payment or discharge of the same shall have actually arrived or not, and notwithstanding that the same are joint debts or liabilities of such Member or his estate and any other person, whether a Member or not. The Directors may at any time, either generally or in any particular case, waive any lien that has arisen or declare any Share to be wholly or in part exempt from the provisions of this Article. The Company's lien, if any, on a Share shall extTermination to all dividTerminations payable thereon. Enforcement 31. The Company may sell, in such manner as the Directors think fit, any Share on which the Company has a lien, provided a sum in respect of which the lien exists is presently payable, and is not paid within fourteen days after a notice in writing has been given to the registered holder  for the time being of the Share, demanding payment of the sum presently payable and giving notice of the intention to sell in default of such payment. Completion of sale 32. For giving effect to any such sale, the Directors may authorise any person to Assignment the Share sold to the purchaser thereof. The purchaser shall be registered as the holder of the Share comprised in any such Assignment and he shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money, nor shall his title to the Share be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings relating to the sale. Application of proceeds 33. The net proceeds of such sale shall be applied in payment or discharge of the debt or liability in respect of which the lien exists and as is presently payable, and any balance shall (subject to a like lien for debts or liabilities not presently payable as existed upon the Shares prior to the sale) be paid to the person who was the registered holder of the Share immediately before such sale. CALLS ON SHARES Calls on Shares generally 34. The Directors may from time to time make calls upon the Members in respect of any moneys unpaid on their Shares (whether in respect of the par value of the Shares or premium or otherwise and not, by the terms of issue thereof, made payable at a future date fixed by or in accordance with such terms of issue); and each Member shall (subject to the Company serving upon him at least 14 days’ notice specifying the time or times and place of payment) pay to the Company at the time or times and place so specified the amount called on his Shares. A call may be revoked or postponed by the Directors wholly or in part as the Directors may determine. A call shall be deemed to have been made at the time when the resolution of the Directors authorising the call was passed. 10 Payment 35. Payment of a call may be made by instalments on the direction of the Directors. 36. If a sum called in respect of a Share is not paid before or on the day appointed for payment thereof, the person from whom the sum is due shall pay interest on the sum from the day payment is due to the time of the actual payment at such rate as the Directors may determine, but the Directors may waive payment of such interest wholly or in part. 37. Any sum payable in respect of a Share on issue or allotment or at any fixed date, whether in respect of the par value of the Share or premium or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a call and if it is not paid all the relevant provisions as to payment of interest, forfeiture or otherwise of these Articles shall apply as if such sum had become due and payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified. 38. The Directors may issue Shares with different terms as to the amount and times of payment of calls. Liability of joint holders 39. The joint holders of a Share shall be jointly and severally liable to pay calls in respect thereof. Interest 40. The Directors may, if they think fit, receive from any Member willing to advance the same, all or any part of the moneys uncalled and unpaid upon any Shares held by him; and may (until the amount would otherwise become payable) pay interest at such rate (not exceeding six per cent without the sanction of the Company in general meeting) as may be agreed upon between the Member paying the sum in advance and the Directors. FORFEITURE OF SHARES Notice 41. If a Member fails to pay any call or instalment of a call by the date it becomes due and payable, the Directors may, at any time thereafter while such call or instalment remains unpaid, give notice to the Member requiring payment of the unpaid portion of the call or instalment, together with any accrued interest and expenses incurred by the Company by reason of such non-payment. 11 42. The notice shall specify where and by what date (not being less than the Termination of 14 days’ from the date of the notice) payment is to be made and shall state that if it is not complied with the Shares in respect of which the call was made will be liable to be forfeited. The Directors may accept the surrTerminationer of any Share liable to be forfeited hereunder and, in such case, references to these Articles to forfeiture shall include surrTerminationer. Forfeiture for non-compliance 43. If such notice is not complied with, any Share in respect of which the notice was given may thereafter, before the payment of all calls or instalments and interest due in respect thereof has been made, be forfeited by a resolution of the Directors. Such forfeiture shall include all dividTerminations declared, other distributions or other monies payable in respect of the forfeited Shares and not paid before the forfeiture. Forfeited Shares 44. A forfeited Share may be sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed of upon such terms and in such manner as the Directors shall think fit, and at any time before a sale, re-allotment or disposition, the forfeiture may be cancelled on such terms as the Directors think fit. Continued liability for forfeited Member 45. A person whose Shares have been forfeited shall cease to be a Member in respect of the forfeited Shares, but shall remain liable to pay to the Company all moneys which at the date of forfeiture were presently payable by him in respect of the Shares together with interest at such rate as the Directors may determine from the date of forfeiture until payment, but his liability shall cease if and when the Company receives payment in full of all amounts due in respect of the Shares. The Company may enforce payment without being under any obligation to make any allowance for the value of the Shares forfeited. Evidence of forfeiture 46. An affidavit in writing by a Director or Secretary of the Company that a Share has been duly forfeited on a specified date, shall be conclusive evidence of the facts stated in it as against all persons claiming to be entitled to the Share. The Company may receive the consideration, if any, given for the Share on any sale, re-allotment or disposition thereof and may authorise some person to execute a Assignment of the Share in favour of the person to whom the Share is sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed of, and he shall thereupon be registered as the holder of the Share, and shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money (if any) nor shall his title to the Share be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings in reference to the forfeiture, sale, re-allotment or disposition of the Share. 12 47. The provisions of these Articles as to forfeiture shall apply in the case of non-payment of any sum which, by the terms of issue of a Share, becomes payable at a fixed time, whether on account of the par value of the Share, or by way of premium or otherwise, as if the same had been made payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified to the Member. INCREASE OF CAPITAL 48. The Company may from time to time by Ordinary Resolution increase its share capital by such sum, to be divided into new Shares of such par value, and with such rights, priorities and privileges attached thereto as the resolution shall prescribe. 49. Subject to any directions given by the Company in a general meeting, all new Shares shall be at the disposal of the Directors in accordance with these Articles. 50. The new Shares shall be subject to the same provisions of these Articles with reference to the payment of calls, lien, forfeiture, Assignment, transmission and otherwise, as the Shares in the original share capital. ALTERATION OF CAPITAL 51. The Company may from time to time by Ordinary Resolution: 51.1 consolidate and divide all or any of its share capital into Shares of larger par value than its existing Shares; 51.2 sub divide its existing Shares, or any of them, into Shares of smaller par value than is fixed by the Memorandum, subject nevertheless to the provisions of section 13 of the Law; 51.3 cancel any Shares which, at the date of the passing of the resolution, have not been taken or agreed to be taken by any person; and 51.4 convert all or any paid up Shares into stock, and reconvert all or any stock into paid up Shares of any denomination. 52. The Company may from time to time by Special Resolution: 52.1 divide its Shares into several classes and attach to such classes any preferential, deferred, or special rights or restrictions in accordance with these Articles; 52.2 change the currency denomination of its share capital; 13 52.3 reduce its share capital and any capital redemption reserve fund in any manner whatsoever; and 52.4 merge or consolidate with any one or more constituent companies (as defined in the Law). GENERAL MEETINGS Convening a meeting 53. The Directors may, whenever they think fit, convene an extraordinary general meeting. If at any time there are not sufficient Directors capable of acting to form a quorum, any Director, or any one or more Members holding in the aggregate not less than one third of the total issued share capital of the Company entitled to vote, may convene an extraordinary general meeting in the same manner as nearly as possible as that in which meetings may be convened by the Directors. Members’ requisition 54. The Directors shall, upon the requisition in writing of one or more Members holding in the aggregate not less than one tenth of such paid up capital of the Company as at the date of the requisition carries the right of voting at general meetings, convene an extraordinary general meeting. Any such requisition shall express the object of the meeting proposed to be called, and must be signed by the requisitionists and deposited at the Registered Office, and may consist of several documents in like form, each signed by one or more requisitionists. 55. If there are no Directors as at the date of the deposit of the Members’ requisition or if the Directors do not convene a general meeting within 21 days from the date of the deposit, the requisitionists or any or any of them or any other Member or Members holding in the aggregate not less than one tenth of such paid up capital of the Company as at the date of the requisition, may convene an extraordinary general meeting. A general meeting convened by requisitionists shall be convened in the same manner as nearly as possible as that in which general meetings are to be convened by the Directors. NOTICE OF GENERAL MEETINGS Length and form of notice 56. At least five clear days’ notice shall be given of any general meeting. Every notice shall specify the place, the day and the time of meeting and, in the case of special business, the general nature of the business to be conducted at the general meeting, and shall be given in the manner provided in these Articles or in such other manner (if any) as may be prescribed by the Company, to such persons as are entitled to receive such notices from the Company. A general meeting may be convened by such shorter notice, or without notice, by a majority in number of the Members having the right to attTermination and vote at the meeting, being a majority together holding not less than ninety-five percent in nominal value of the Shares giving that right. 14 Omission or non-receipt 57. The accidental omission to give notice of a meeting to, or the non-receipt of a notice of a meeting by, any Member entitled to receive notice shall not invalidate the proceedings at any meeting. PROCEEDINGS AT GENERAL MEETINGS 58. All business shall be deemed special that is transacted at an extraordinary general meeting. Quorum 59. No business shall be transacted at any general meeting unless a quorum of Members is present at the time that the meeting proceeds to business, but the absence of a quorum shall not preclude the appointment, choice or election of a chairman, which shall not be treated as part of the business of the Meeting. Save as herein otherwise provided, one or more Members holding in the aggregate not less than one third of the total issued share capital of the Company present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall be a quorum. Adjournment for lack of quorum 60. If within five minutes (or such longer time as the chairman of the meeting may determine to wait) after the time appointed for the meeting, a quorum is not present, the meeting, if convened upon the requisition of Members, shall be dissolved. In any other case, it shall stand adjourned to the same day in the next week, at the same time and place, and if at the adjourned meeting a quorum is not present within half an hour from the time appointed for the meeting, the Members present shall be a quorum. Meeting by telephone or other facilities 61. A meeting of the Members may be held by telephone, electronic or other communication facilities (including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, by telephone or video conferencing) by which all persons participating in the meeting can communicate with each other simultaneously and instantaneously, and participation in such a general meeting shall constitute presence in person at such meeting. 62. Any Director shall be entitled to attTermination and speak at any general meeting of the Company. 15 Appointment of chairman 63. The chairman (if any) of the Board of Directors shall preside as chairman at every general meeting of the Company. If there is no such chairman, or if at any meeting he is not present within five minutes after the time appointed for holding the meeting or is unwilling to act as chairman, the Directors present shall choose one of their number to act or, if only one Director is present, he shall preside as chairman if willing to act. If no Director is present, or if each of the Directors present declines to take the chair, the Members present and entitled to vote shall elect one of their number to be chairman. Adjournment of meeting 64. The chairman may, with the consent of a meeting at which a quorum is present (and shall if so directed by the meeting) adjourn the meeting from time to time and from place to place, but no business shall be transacted at any adjourned meeting other than the business left unfinished at the meeting from which the adjournment took place. When a meeting is adjourned for ten days or more, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given as in the case of an original meeting. Save as aforesaid, it shall not be necessary to give any notice of an adjournment or of the business to be transacted at an adjourned meeting. VOTING Ordinary Resolution Save where a Special Resolution or other greater majority is required by the Law or these Articles, any question proposed for consideration at any general meeting shall be decided by an Ordinary Resolution. Voting on a show of hands 65. At any general meeting, a resolution put to the vote of the meeting shall be decided on a show of hands, unless before or on the declaration of the result of the show of hands, or on the withdrawal of any other demand for a poll. Demand for poll 66. A poll is demanded by: 66.1 the chairman of the meeting; or 66.2 at least three Members present in person or by proxy; or 66.3 any Member or Members present in person or by proxy and holding collectively not less than one tenth of the total voting rights of all the Members having the right to vote at such meeting; or 16 66.4 a Member or Members present in person or by proxy holding Shares conferring the right to vote at such meeting, being Shares on which an aggregate sum has been paid up equal to not less than one tenth of the total sum paid up on all such Shares conferring such right. 67. Unless a poll is duly demanded and the demand is not withdrawn, a declaration by the chairman that a resolution has, on a show of hands, been carried or carried unanimously, or by a particular majority, or lost and an entry to that effect in the minutes of the proceedings of the Company shall be conclusive evidence of that fact, without proof of the number or proportion of the votes recorded in favour of, or against, that resolution. The demand for a poll may be withdrawn by the person or any persons making it at any time prior to the declaration of the result of the poll. 68. If a poll is duly demanded, it shall be taken in such manner as the chairman directs, and the result of the poll shall be deemed to be the resolution of the meeting at which the poll was demanded. 69. In the case of an equality of votes at a general meeting, whether on a show of hands or on a poll, the chairman of the meeting at which the show of hands takes place or at which the poll is demanded, shall not be entitled to a second or casting vote and the resolution shall fail. 70. A poll demanded on the election of a chairman or on a question of adjournment shall be taken forthwith. A poll demanded on any other question shall be taken in such manner and either forthwith or at such time later in the meeting as the chairman of the meeting shall direct. 71. The demand for a poll shall not prevent the continuance of a meeting for the transaction of any business other than the question on which the poll has been demanded and it may be withdrawn at any time before the close of the meeting or the taking of the poll, whichever is the earlier. Voting on a poll 72. On a poll votes may be cast either personally or by proxy. 73. A person entitled to more than one vote on a poll need not use all his votes or cast all the votes he uses in the same way. 74. On a show of hands, every Member present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall have one vote. On a poll, every Member present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall have one vote for each Share of which he is the registered holder. 17 75. In the case of joint holders of a Share, the vote of the senior who tTerminationers a vote, whether in person or by proxy, shall be accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint holders; and for this purpose seniority shall be determined by the order in which the names stand in the Register of Members in respect of the joint holding. 76. A Member of unsound mind, or, in respect of whom an order has been made by any court having jurisdiction in lunacy, may vote, whether on a show of hands or on a poll, by his receiver, committee, curator bonis or other person of similar nature appointed by such court, and any such receiver, committee, curator bonis or other person may vote by proxy and may otherwise act and be treated as such Member for the purpose of the general meetings. 77. No Member, unless the Directors otherwise determine, shall be entitled to vote at any general meeting, unless all calls or other sums presently payable by him in respect of Shares in the Company have been paid. 78. No objection shall be raised as to the qualification of any voter or as to whether any votes have been properly counted except at the general meeting or adjourned general meeting at which the vote objected to is given or tTerminationered and every vote not disallowed at the meeting shall be valid. Any objection made in due time and in accordance with these Articles shall be referred to the chairman whose decision shall be final and conclusive. Shareholder Restricted Matters 78A.

Notwithstanding any provision in these Articles to the contrary, a sole Director shall be entitled to exercise all of the powers and functions of the Directors which may be imposed on them by Law or by these Articles. PROCEEDINGS OF DIRECTORS Regulating proceedings 104. The Directors may meet together (either within or without the Cayman Islands) for the despatch of business, adjourn and otherwise regulate their meetings and proceedings, as they think fit. Questions arising at any meeting shall be decided by a majority of votes. In case of an equality of votes the chairman shall not have a second or casting vote and the motion shall be deemed to have been lost. Convening a meeting 105. A Director or alternate Director may, and the Secretary on the requisition of a Director or alternate Director shall, at any time, summon a meeting of Directors by at least five days’ notice in writing to every Director and alternate Director which notice shall set forth the general nature of the business to be considered provided however that notice may be waived by all the Directors (or their alternates) either at, before or retrospectively after the meeting is held provided further that notice or waiver thereof may be given by email or fax. Quorum 106. The quorum for the transaction of the business of the Directors may be fixed by the Directors and unless so fixed by the Directors, shall be [three] Directors consisting of at least [two] HLMP Directors, and shall be one if there is a sole Director . An alternate appointed by a Director shall be counted in a quorum at a meeting at which the Director appointing him is not present provided always that where a Director is acting in his own right and also as an alternate he is only counted once in the quorum. A Director who ceases to be a Director at a meeting of the Directors may continue to be present and to act as a Director and be counted in the quorum until the termination of the meeting provided no other Director objects and if otherwise a quorum of Directors would not be present. Vacancies 107. The continuing Directors may act notwithstanding any vacancy in their body, but, if and so long as their number is reduced below the number fixed by or pursuant to these Articles as the necessary quorum of Directors, the continuing Directors may act for the purpose of increasing the number of Directors to that number, or of summoning a general meeting of the Company, but for no other purpose. 25 Chairman 108. The Directors may elect a chairman of their meetings and determine the period for which he is to hold office; but if no such chairman is elected, or if at any meeting the chairman is not present within five minutes after the time appointed for holding the same, the Directors present may choose one of their number to be chairman of the meeting. Written resolutions of Directors 109. A resolution in writing signed by all of the Directors or all of the members of a committee of Directors for the time being entitled to receive notice of a meeting of the Directors (or by an alternate Director as provided in these Articles), including a resolution signed in counterpart and/or sent or evidenced by way of signed fax or electronic transmission, shall be as valid and effectual as if it had been passed at a meeting of the Directors or of a committee of Directors duly called and constituted. Meeting by telephone or other facilities 110. To the extent permitted by law, a meeting of the Directors or a committee appointed by the Directors may be held by means of such telephone, electronic or other communication facilities (including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, by telephone or by video conferencing) as permit all persons participating in the meeting to communicate with each other simultaneously and instantaneously and participation in such a meeting shall constitute presence in person at such meeting. Such a meeting shall be deemed to take place where the largest group of those Directors participating in the meeting is physically assembled, or, if there is no such group, where the chairman of the meeting then is. Validity of acts in spite of defect 111. All acts done by any meeting of the Directors or of a committee of Directors, or by any person acting as a Director shall, notwithstanding that it be afterwards discovered that there was some defect in the appointment of any such Director or person acting as aforesaid, or that they or any of them were disqualified, be as valid as if every such person had been duly appointed and was qualified to be a Director. Minutes 112. The Directors shall cause minutes to be made and records kept for the purpose of recording: 26 112.1 all appointments of officers made by the Directors; 112.2 the names of the Directors and other persons present at each meeting of the Directors and of any committee of the Directors; and 112.3 all resolutions and proceedings at all meetings of the Members of the Company or any class of Members and of the Directors and of committees of Directors; and the chairman of all such meetings or of any meeting confirming the minutes thereof shall sign the same. DIRECTORS’ INTERESTS 113. A Director may hold any other office or place of profit with the Company (except that of Auditor) in conjunction with his office of Director for such period and upon such terms as to remuneration and otherwise as the Directors may determine. 114. A Director or officer may act by himself or his firm in a professional capacity for the Company (otherwise than as Auditor), and he or his firm shall be entitled to remuneration for professional services as if he were not a Director or officer. 115. No Director or officer shall be disqualified from his office or prevented by such office from holding any office or place of profit under the Company or under any company in which the Company shall be a Member or have any interest, or from contracting with the Company, either as vTerminationor, purchaser or otherwise, nor shall any such contract or any contract or transaction entered into by or on behalf of the Company in which any Director or officer shall be in any way interested be or be liable to be avoided nor shall any Director or officer so contracting, dealing or being so interested be liable to account to the Company for any profit realised by any such contract or transaction by reason of such Director holding office or of the fiduciary relation thereby established. Disclosure and nature of interest 116. A Director (or his alternate Director in his absence) shall be at liberty to vote in respect of any contract or transaction in which he is interested provided that the nature of the interest of the Director in any such contract or transaction shall be disclosed by him at or prior to its consideration and any vote thereon. 117. The nature of the interest of any Director or officer in any contract, dealing or transacting with or affecting the Company shall be disclosed by him at or prior to its consideration and any vote thereon and a general notice that a Director or officer is a shareholder of any specified firm or company and/or is to be regarded as interested in any transaction with such firm or company shall be sufficient disclosure hereunder and after such general notice it shall not be necessary to give special notice relating to any particular transaction. 27 DELEGATION OF DIRECTORS’ POWERS Power to delegate 118. Directors may from time to time and at any time by power of attorney or otherwise appoint any company, firm or person or fluctuating body of persons, whether nominated directly or indirectly by the Directors, to be the attorney or attorneys of the Company for such purposes and with such powers, authorities and discretions (not exceeding those vested in or exercisable by the Directors under these Articles) and for such period and subject to such conditions as they may think fit, and any such power of attorney may contain such provisions for the protection and convenience of persons dealing with any such attorney and of such attorney as the Directors may think fit and may also authorise any such attorney to delegate all or any of the powers, authorities and discretions vested in him. 119. The Directors may delegate any of the powers exercisable by them to a Managing Director , Director or any other person or persons acting individually or jointly as they may from time to time by resolution appoint upon such terms and conditions and with such restrictions as they may think fit, and may from time to time by resolution revoke, withdraw, alter or vary all or any such powers. Alternate Directors 120. Any Director may by writing appoint any other Director, or other person willing to act, to be his alternate and remove his alternate so appointed by him. Such appointment or removal shall be by notice to the Registered Office signed by the Director making or revoking the appointment or in any other manner approved by the Directors, and shall be effective on the date the notice is served and the alternate shall be notified of such appointment or revocation. Subject to the removal by the appointing Director, the alternate shall continue in office until the date on which his appointor ceases to be a Director. An alternate may also be a Director in his own right and may act as alternate to more than one Director. 121. An alternate shall be entitled to receive notice of all meetings of the Directors, attTermination, be counted in the quorum, vote and act in such appointor’s place at every such meeting at which the appointing Director is not personally present, and generally to perform all the functions of his appointor as a Director in his absence. 122. These Articles (except as regards powers to appoint an alternate and remuneration) apply equally to the alternate as though he were the Director in his own right. 123. An alternate Director shall be deemed for all purposes to be a Director and shall alone be responsible for his own acts and defaults and shall not be deemed to be the agent of the Director appointing him. The signature of an alternate to any resolution in writing of the Director or a committee there shall, unless the terms of the appointment provides to the contrary, be as effective as the signature of the Director or Directors to whom he is alternate. 28 Committees of Directors 124. The Directors may delegate any of their powers to committees consisting of such member or members of their body as they think fit; any committee so formed shall, in the exercise of the powers so delegated, conform to any regulations that may be imposed on it by the Directors. 125. A committee may elect a chairman of its meetings; if no such chairman is elected, or if at any meeting the chairman is not present within five minutes after the time appointed for holding the same, the members present may choose one of their number to be chairman of the meeting. 126. A committee may meet and adjourn as it thinks proper. Questions arising at any meeting shall be determined by a majority of votes of the members present and in case of an equality of votes the chairman shall not have a second or casting vote and the motion shall be deemed to have been lost. Officers 127. The Directors may appoint a Secretary and such other officers as they may from time to time consider necessary upon such terms as to duration of office, remuneration and otherwise as they may think fit. Such Secretary or other officers need not be Directors and in the case of the other officers may be ascribed such titles as the Directors may decide and the Directors may revoke or terminate any such election or appointment. Any such revocation or termination shall be without prejudice to any claim for any damages that such officer may have against the Company or the Company may have against such officer for any breach of any contract of service between him and the Company which may be involved in such revocation or termination. Save as provided in the Law or these Articles, the powers and duties of the officers of the Company shall be such (if any) as are determined from time to time by the Directors. DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION Remuneration 128. The remuneration to be paid to the Directors, if any, shall be determined by the Company in general meeting or, in the absence of such a determination, by the Directors. Expenses 129. Each Director shall also be entitled to be paid his reasonable travelling, hotel and other expenses properly incurred by him in connection with his attTerminationance at meetings of the Directors, committees of the Directors or general meetings of the Company, or otherwise in connection with the business of the Company, or to receive a fixed allowance in respect thereof as may be determined by the Directors, or a combination partly of one such method and partly the other. 29 Additional remuneration 130. The Directors may by resolution approve additional remuneration to any Director for services which in the opinion of the Directors go beyond the ordinary duties of a Director, and such extra remuneration shall be in addition to any remuneration provided for, by or pursuant to any other Article. SEALS AND DEEDS Use of Seal 131. The Directors may determine that the Company shall have a Seal, and if they so determine, shall provide for the safe custody of the Seal. The Seal shall only be used by the authority of the Directors and in the presence of a Director or the Secretary or such other person as the Directors may by resolution appoint for this purpose, and every instrument to which the Seal affixed shall be signed by the relevant person. Notwithstanding the above, annual returns and notices filed under the Law may be executed either as a deed or under Seal and in either case without the need for the authority of a resolution of the Directors. 30 Duplicate Seal 132. The Company may maintain in any place or places outside the Cayman Islands a facsimile of any Seal and such facsimile seal shall be affixed in the same way as if it were the Seal. Execution of deeds 133. In accordance with the Law, the Company may execute any deed or other instrument (which would otherwise be required to be executed under Seal) by the signature of such deed or instrument as a deed by a Director or by the Secretary of the Company or by such other person as the Directors may appoint or by any other person or attorney on behalf of the Company appointed by a deed or other instrument executed as a deed by a Director or the Secretary or such other person as aforesaid. DIVIDTerminationS Payment of DividTerminations 134. The Directors may from time to time declare dividTerminations to be paid to the Members according to their rights and interests, including such interim dividTerminations as appear to the Directors to be justified by the position of the Company. The Directors may also pay any fixed cash dividTermination which is payable on any Shares of the Company half yearly or on such other dates, whenever the position of the Company, in the opinion of the Directors, justifies such payment. 135. No dividTermination shall be paid otherwise than out of profits or out of monies otherwise available for dividTermination in accordance with the Law. Calculation of DividTerminations 136. Subject to the rights of Members, if any, entitled to Shares with special rights as to dividTerminations, all dividTerminations shall be declared and paid according to the amount paid up on the Shares in respect of which the dividTermination is paid and any dividTermination on any class of Shares not fully paid shall be declared and paid according to the amounts paid on the Shares of that class, but if and so long as nothing is paid up on any of the Shares in the Company, dividTerminations may be declared and paid according to the number of Shares. No amount paid on a Share in advance of calls shall, while carrying interest, be treated for the purposes of this Article as paid on the Share. DividTerminations may be apportioned and paid pro rata according to the amounts paid-up on the Shares during any portion or portions of the period in respect of which the dividTermination is paid. 31 Deductions 137. The Directors may deduct from any dividTermination, distribution or other monies payable to a Member by the Company on or in respect of any Shares all sums of money (if any) presently payable by him to the Company on account of calls or otherwise in respect of Shares of the Company. Joint Holders 138. If several persons are registered as joint holders of any Share, any of them may give effectual receipts for any dividTermination or other money payable on or in respect of the Share. Payment method 139. Any dividTermination may be paid by cheque or warrant sent through the post to the address of the Member or person entitled thereto in the Register of Members or, in the case of joint holders addressed to the holder whose name stands first in the Register of Members in respect of the Shares at his registered address as appearing on the Register of Members or to such person and such address as the Member or person entitled or such joint holders as the case may be may direct in writing. Every such cheque or warrant shall, unless the holder or joint holders may in writing direct, be made payable to the order of the person to whom it is sent or to the order of the holder or, in the case of joint holders, to the order of the holder whose name stands first in the Register of Members in respect of such Shares, and shall be sent at his or their risk and payment of the cheque or warrant by the bank on which it is drawn shall constitute a good discharge to the Company. Any one of two or more joint holders may give effectual receipts for any dividTerminations, distributions or other monies payable or property distributable in respect of the Shares held by such joint holders. Satisfaction by distribution of specific assets 140. The Directors may declare that any dividTermination or distribution is paid wholly or partly by the distribution of specific assets and, in particular, of paid up shares, debentures or debenture stock of any other company or in any one or more of such ways, and where any difficulty arises in regard to such dividTermination or distribution, the Directors may settle the same as they think expedient, and in particular may issue fractional Shares or ignore fractions altogether and may fix the value for dividTermination or distribution of such specific assets or any part thereof and may determine that cash payments shall be made to any Members upon the basis of the value so fixed in order to secure equality of distribution, and may vest any such specific assets in trustees as may seem expedient to the Directors. 32 No interest 141. No dividTermination or other distribution or other monies payable by the Company on or in respect of any Share shall bear interest against the Company. Unclaimed dividTerminations 142. All unclaimed dividTerminations or distributions may be invested or otherwise made use of by the Directors for the benefit of the Company until claimed. Any dividTermination or distribution unclaimed by a Member six years after the dividTermination or distribution payment date shall be forfeited and revert to the Company. RESERVES 143. The Directors may, before declaring any dividTermination or distribution, set aside such sums as they think proper as a reserve or reserves which shall, at the discretion of the Directors, be applicable for meeting contingencies, or for equalising dividTerminations, or for any other purpose of the Company, and pTerminationing such application may, in their discretion, be employed in the business of the Company or be invested in such manner as the Directors may from time to time think fit. The Directors may also without placing the same to reserve carry forward any sums which they think it prudent not to distribute. CAPITALISATION OF PROFITS Capitalisation 144. The Directors may capitalise any sum standing to the credit of any of the Company’s reserve accounts which are available for distribution (including its Share Premium Account and capital redemption reserve fund, subject to the Law) or any sum standing to the credit of the profit and loss account or otherwise available for distribution and to appropriate such sums to Members in the proportions in which such sum would have been divisible amongst them had the same been a distribution of profits by way of dividTermination and to apply such sum on their behalf in paying up in full unissued Shares for allotment and distribution credited as fully paid-up to and amongst them in the proportion aforesaid. Authorisation 145. Where any difficulty arises in regard to any distribution under the last preceding Article, the Directors may settle the same as they think expedient and, in particular, may authorise any person to sell and Assignment any fractions or may resolve that the distribution should be as nearly as may be practicable in the correct proportion but not exactly so or may ignore fractions altogether, and may determine that cash payments should be made to any Members in order to adjust the rights of all parties, as may seem expedient to the Directors. The Directors may appoint any person to sign on behalf of the persons entitled to participate in the distribution any contract necessary or desirable for giving effect thereto and such appointment shall be effective and binding upon the Members. 33 SHARE PREMIUM ACCOUNT 146. The Directors shall in accordance with the Law establish a Share Premium Account and shall carry to the credit of such account from time to time a sum equal to the amount or value of the premium paid on the issue of any Share. 147. There shall be debited to any Share Premium Account on the redemption or purchase of a Share the difference between the nominal value of such Share and the redemption or purchase price provided always that at the discretion of the Directors such sum may be paid out of the profits of the Company or, if permitted by the Law, out of capital. ACCOUNTING RECORDS Books of account 148. The Directors shall cause to be kept accounting records sufficient to give a true and fair view of the state of the Company's affairs and to show and explain its transactions and otherwise in accordance with the Law. Inspection by Members 149. The accounting records shall be kept at the Registered Office or at such other place or places as the Directors think fit, and shall at all times be open to inspection by the Directors. No Member (who is not also a Director) shall have any right to inspect any accounting record or book or document of the Company except as conferred by law or authorised by the Directors or by the Members by Ordinary Resolution. Records and audit 150. From time to time the Company in general meeting may determine (or revoke, alter or amTermination any such determination) or, failing such determination, the Directors may determine (or revoke, alter or amTermination any such determination): 150.1 that the accounts of the Company be audited and the appointment of the Auditors; 150.2 that there be prepared and sent to each Member and other person entitled thereto a profit and loss account, a balance sheet, group accounts and/or reports for such period and on such terms as they may determine; and 150.3 that there be laid before the Company in general meeting a copy of every balance sheet together with a copy of the Auditor's report. 34 SERVICE OF NOTICES AND DOCUMENTS Form and delivery of notices 151. Notices or other documents or communications may be given to any Member by the Company either personally or by sTerminationing it by courier, post, fax or email to him to his registered address, or (if he has no registered address) to the address, if any, supplied by him to the Company for the giving of notices to him. Any notice shall be deemed to be effected: 151.1 if delivered personally or sent by courier, by properly addressing and prepaying a letter containing the notice; and to have been effected, in the case of a notice of a meeting, when delivered; 151.2 if sent by post, by properly addressing, prepaying, and posting a letter containing the notice (by airmail if available) and to have been effected, in the case of a notice of a meeting, at the Termination of three days after it was posted; and 151.3 if sent by fax or email by properly addressing and sTerminationing such notice through the appropriate transmitting medium and to have been effected on the day the same is sent. 152. A notice may be given by the Company to the joint holders of a Share by giving the notice to the joint holder named first in the Register of Members in respect of the Share. 153. A notice may be given by the Company to the person entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a Member by sTerminationing it through the post in a prepaid letter addressed to them by name, or by the title of representatives of the deceased, or trustee of the bankrupt, or by any like description, at the address, if any, supplied for the purpose by the persons claiming to be so entitled, or (until such an address has been so supplied) by giving the notice in any manner in which the same might have been given if the death or bankruptcy had not occurred. 154. Notice of every general meeting shall be given in any manner hereinbefore authorised to: 154.1 every Member entitled to vote except those Members entitled to vote who (having no registered address) have not supplied to the Company an address for the giving of notices to them; and 154.2 every person entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a Member, who, but for his death or bankruptcy would be entitled to receive notice of the meeting. 155. No other persons shall be entitled to receive notices of general meeting. 35 WINDING UP Method of winding up 156. Subject to the rights attaching to any Shares, if the Company shall be wound up, the liquidator may, with the sanction of a Special Resolution and any other sanction required by the Law or these Articles, divide amongst the Members in kind the whole or any part of the assets of the Company (whether they shall consist of property of the same kind or not) and may for such purpose set such value as he deems fair upon any property to be divided as aforesaid and may determine how such division shall be carried out as between the Members or different classes of Members. The liquidator may, with the like sanction, vest the whole or any part of such assets in trustees upon such trusts for the benefit of the contributories as the liquidator, with the like sanction, shall think fit, but so that no Member shall be compelled to accept any asset upon which there is any liability. Distribution of assets 157. If the Company shall be wound up and the assets available for distribution amongst the Members as such shall be insufficient to repay the whole of the paid up capital, such assets shall be distributed so that, as nearly as may be, the losses shall be borne by the Members in proportion to the capital paid up, or which ought to have been paid up, at the commencement of the winding up, on the Shares held by them respectively. And if in a winding up the assets available for distribution amongst the Members shall be more than sufficient to repay the whole of the capital paid up at the commencement of the winding up, the excess shall be distributed amongst the Members in proportion to the capital paid up at the commencement of the winding up on the Shares held by them respectively. This Article is to be without prejudice to the rights of the holders of Shares issued upon special terms and conditions. Indemnification Indemnification and limitation of liability 158. Every Indemnified Person shall, in the absence of wilful neglect or default, be indemnified and held harmless out of the assets of the Company against all liabilities, loss, damage, cost or expense (including but not limited to liabilities under contract, tort and statute or any applicable foreign law or regulation and all reasonable legal and other costs and expenses on a full Indemnification basis properly payable) incurred or suffered by him by or by reason of any act done, conceived in or omitted in the conduct of the Company’s business or in the discharge of his duties and the Indemnification contained in this Article shall extTermination to any Indemnified Person acting in any office or trust in the reasonable belief that he has been appointed or elected to such office or trust notwithstanding any defect in such appointment or election. 36 159. No Indemnified Person shall be liable to the Company for acts, defaults or omissions of any other Indemnified Person. Indemnification and reimbursement 160. Every Indemnified Person shall be indemnified out of the funds of the Company against all liabilities incurred by him by or by reason of any act done, conceived in or omitted in the conduct of the Company’s business or in the discharge of his duties in defTerminationing any proceedings, whether civil or criminal, in which judgment is given in his favour, or in which he is acquitted, or in connection with any application in which relief from liability is granted to him by the court. 161. To the extent that any Indemnified Person is entitled to claim an Indemnification pursuant to these Articles in respect of amounts paid or discharged by him, the relative Indemnification shall take effect as an obligation of the Company to reimburse the person making such payment or effecting such discharge. Wilful neglect or default 162. Each Member and the Company agree to waive any claim or right of action he or it may at any time have, whether individually or by or in the right of the Company, against any Indemnified Person on account of any act or omission of such Indemnified Person in the performance of his duties for the Company; provided however, that such waiver shall not apply to any claims or rights of action arising out of the wilful neglect or default of such Indemnified Person or to recover any gain, personal profit or advantage to which such Indemnified Person is not legally entitled. Advance of legal fees 163. Expenses incurred in defTerminationing any civil or criminal action or proceeding for which indemnification is required pursuant to these Articles shall be paid by the Company in advance of the final disposition of such action or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnified Person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that the Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified pursuant to these Articles. Each Member of the Company shall be deemed to have acknowledged and agreed that the advances of funds may be made by the Company as aforesaid, and when made by the Company under this Article are made to meet expTerminationitures incurred for the purpose of enabling such Indemnified Person to properly perform his or her duties to the Company. 37 CONTINUATION 164. The Company shall have the power, subject to the provisions of the Law and with the approval of a Special Resolution, to continue as a body incorporated under the laws of any jurisdiction outside of the Cayman Islands and to be de-registered in the Cayman Islands. AMTerminationMENT OF MEMORANDUM AND ARTICLES Subject to the provisions of the Law, the Company may from time to time by Special Resolution alter or amTermination the Memorandum or these Articles in whole or in part provided that no such amTerminationment shall affect the special rights attaching to any class of Shares without the consent or sanction provided for in these Articles. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Memorandum or in these Articles or in Law, for so long as HLNG is a Member, the Company shall not alter or amTermination the Memorandum or these Articles in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of HLNG 38 SCHEDULE A INSURANCE POLICIES Hull & Material Adverse Effecthinery insurance: All insurances carried, or to be carried, by the owner of the Vessel are placed as part of Höegh LNG’s fleet placements in the international insurance markets.

All references herein to Articles, Sections, Exhibits and Schedules shall, unless the context requires a different construction, be deemed to be references to the Articles and Sections of this Agreement and the Exhibits and Schedules attached hereto, and all such Exhibits and Schedules attached hereto are hereby incorporated herein and made a part hereof for all purposes. All personal pronouns used in this Agreement, whether used in the masculine, feminine or neuter gTerminationer, shall include all other gTerminationers, and the singular shall include the plural and vice versa. The use herein of the word “including” following any general statement, term or matter shall not be construed to limit such statement, term or matter to the specific items or matters set forth immediately following such word or to similar items or matters, whether or not non-limiting language (such as “without limitation,” “but not limited to” or words of similar import) is used with reference thereto, but rather shall be deemed to refer to all other items or matters that could reasonably fall within the broadest possible scope of such general statement, term or matter. 25 Section 10.3 \n                    Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and assigns. Section 10.4 No Third Party Rights. The provisions of this Agreement are intTerminationed to bind the Parties as to each other and are not intTerminationed to and do not create rights in any other person or confer upon any other person any benefits, rights or remedies, and no person is or is intTerminationed to be a third party beneficiary of any of the provisions of this Agreement. Section 10.5 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts with the same effect as if all signatory Parties had signed the same document.

Section 10.6 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York. Section 10.7 Dispute Resolution. Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach thereof, shall be determined by Dispute Resolution administered by the International Centre for Dispute Resolution of the American Dispute Resolution Association in accordance with its International Dispute Resolution Rules (the “ Rules ”).

If any of the provisions of this Agreement are held by any court of competent jurisdiction to contravene, or to be invalid under, the laws of any governmental body having jurisdiction over the subject matter hereof, such contravention or invalidity shall not invalidate the entire Agreement. Instead, this Agreement shall be construed as if it did not contain the particular provision or provisions held to be invalid and an equitable adjustment shall be made and necessary provision added so as to give effect, as nearly as possible, to the intention of the Parties as expressed in this Agreement at the time of execution of this Agreement. 26 Section 10.9 Deed; Bill of Sale; Assignment. To the extent required and permitted by Governing Law, this Agreement shall also constitute a “deed,” “bill of sale” or “assignment” of the interests referenced herein. Section 10.10 Integration.

Holders of the Senior Obligations will be entitled to receive payment in full of all Senior Obligations before Payee will be entitled to receive any payment with respect to the Junior Obligations in the event of any distribution to creditors of Payor: (i) in a liquidation or dissolution of Payor; (ii) in a bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, receivership or similar proceeding relating to Payor and its properties; (iii) in an assignment for the benefit of creditors; (iv) in any marshalling of the assets and liabilities of Payor; or (v) at any time during which a Default (as defined in the MUSD 412 Facility) has occurred and is continuing. For so long as no Default (as defined in the MUSD 412 Facility) has occurred and is continuing at such time, Payor may make (and Payee may receive and retain and apply in satisfaction of the Junior Obligations) payments of the Junior Obligations from time to time in its sole and absolute discretion. Amounts received by Payee in respect of the Junior Obligations when payment thereof is prohibited by this Section 5 shall be held by Payee in trust for the benefit of the holders of the Senior Obligations and turned over to the holders of the Senior Obligations upon the written request of the Security Trustee (as defined under the MUSD 412 Facility). 6. \n        MISCELLANEOUS Payor agrees to pay on demand all the losses, costs, and expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees and disbursements) which Payee incurs in connection with enforcement of this Note, or the protection or preservation of Payee’s rights under this Note, whether by judicial proceedings or otherwise. Such costs and expenses include, without limitation, those incurred in connection with any workout or refinancing, or any bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation or similar proceedings. No single or partial exercise of any power under this Note shall preclude any other or further exercise of such power or exercise of any other power. No delay or omission on the part of Payee in exercising any right under this Note shall operate as a waiver of such right or any other right hereunder.

The Directors may fix in advance a date as the record date to determine the Members entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of the Members and, for the purpose of determining the Members entitled to receive payment of any dividTermination, the Directors may, at or within 90 days prior to the date of the declaration of such dividTermination, fix a subsequent date as the record date for such determination. No fixed record date 11. If no such record date is fixed, the record date shall be the date on which notice of the meeting is sent or the date on which the resolution of the Directors declaring such dividTermination is adopted, as the case may be. A determination of Members entitled to vote at any meeting of Members in accordance with this Article, shall apply to any adjournment thereof. SHARE CERTIFICATES Issue of Share Certificates 12. Every Member shall be entitled, without payment, to a certificate of the Company specifying the Share or Shares held by him and the amount paid up thereon. 13. Notwithstanding the provisions of these Articles, the Directors may resolve not to issue share certificates to Members of the Company. Certificates for jointly-held Shares 14. The Company shall not be bound to issue more than one certificate for Shares held jointly by more than one person, and delivery of a certificate to one joint holder shall be sufficient delivery to all. Replacement Share Certificates 15. If a share certificate is defaced, lost or destroyed, it may be replaced on payment of such fee (if any) and on such terms (if any) as to evidence and Indemnification, and on the payment of expenses of the Company in investigating such evidence and preparing such Indemnification as the Directors shall think fit and, in case of defacement, on delivery of the old certificate to the Company for cancellation. 6 Assignment OF SHARES Instrument of Assignment 16. The instrument of Assignment of any Share shall be executed by or on behalf of the Assignmentor (and, if the Directors so determine, the Assignmentee). The Assignmentor shall be deemed to remain the holder of the Share until the name of the Assignmentee is entered in the Register of Members in respect of such Share. All instruments of Assignment, once registered, may be retained by the Company. 17. Subject to any applicable restrictions contained in these Articles, Shares shall be Assignmentred in any usual or common form approved by the Directors. Refusal to register Assignments 18. The Directors may, in their absolute discretion and without assigning any reason therefore, decline to register any Assignment of any Share. The Directors may require reasonable evidence to show the right of the Assignmentor to make the Assignment. 19. If the Directors decline to register a Assignment of Shares they shall sTermination notice of the refusal to the Assignmentee within one month after the date on which the Assignment was lodged with the Company. 20. The Directors may also suspTermination the registration of the Assignments at such times and for such periods as the Directors may from time to time determine. TRANSMISSION OF SHARES Transmission of Shares 21. If a Member dies, the survivor or survivors (where he was a joint holder), and the legal personal representative (where he was sole holder), shall be the only person recognised by the Company as having any title to the Share. The estate of a deceased Member is not thereby released from any liability in respect of any Share held by him, whether solely or jointly. For the purpose of this Article, legal personal representative means the person to whom probate or letters of administration has or have been granted in the Cayman Islands or, if there is no such person, such other person as the Directors may in their absolute discretion determine to be the person recognised by the Company for the purpose of this Article. Election by persons entitled on transmission 22. Any person becoming entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a Member or otherwise by operation of Governing Law may elect, upon such evidence being produced as may be required by the Directors as to his entitlement, either be registered himself as a Member in respect of the Share or, instead of being registered himself, to make such Assignment of the Share as the deceased or bankrupt Member could have made. 7 Manner of election 23. If the person so becoming entitled elects to be registered himself, he shall deliver or sTermination to the Company a notice in writing signed by him stating that he so elects. If he shall elect to Assignment the Shares, he shall signify his election by signing an instrument of Assignment of such Shares in favour of his Assignmentee. All the limitations, restrictions and provisions of these Articles relating to the right to Assignment and the registration of Assignments of Shares shall be applicable to any such notice or instrument of Assignment as aforesaid as if the death of the Member or other event giving rise to the transmission had not occurred and the notice or instrument of Assignment was an instrument of Assignment signed by such Member. Rights of persons entitled on transmission 24. A person becoming entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of the Member (or otherwise by operation of Governing Law), upon such evidence being produced as may be required by the Directors as to his entitlement, shall be entitled to the same dividTerminations and other monies payable in respect of the Share as he would be entitled if he were the holder of such Share. However, he shall not be entitled, until he becomes registered as the holder of such Share, to receive notices of or to attTermination or vote at general meetings of the Company or (except as aforesaid) to exercise any other rights or privileges of a Member. The Directors may at any time give notice requiring such person to elect either to be registered himself or to Assignment the Share and, if the notice is not complied with within sixty days, the Directors may thereafter withhold payment of all dividTerminations and other monies payable in respect of the Shares until the requirements of the notice have been complied with. REDEMPTION AND PURCHASE OF SHARES 25. Subject to the provisions of the Law and the Memorandum, the Company may: 25.1 purchase its own Shares (including any redeemable Shares) in such manner and on such terms as the Directors may agree with the relevant Member unless following such purchase there would no longer be any issued Shares and may make payment for such purchase or for any redemption of Shares in any manner authorised by the Law, including out of capital; and 25.2 reduce its share capital and any capital redemption reserve fund in any manner whatsoever. 8 VARIATION OF SHARE RIGHTS Variation of class rights 26. If at any time the share capital is divided into different classes of Shares, all or any of the special rights attached to any class of Shares (unless otherwise provided by the terms of issue of the Shares of that class) may be varied or abrogated with the consent in writing of the holders of not less than two thirds of the issued Shares of that class or with the sanction of a resolution passed by the holders of not less than two thirds of the issued Shares of that class as may be present in person or by proxy at a separate general meeting of the holders of the Shares of that class. To any such separate general meeting, all of the provisions of these Articles relating to general meetings shall mutatis mutandis apply, but so that the necessary quorum shall be any one or more persons holding or representing by proxy not less than one third of the issued Shares of the class and that any holder of Shares of the relevant class present in person or by proxy may demand a poll. Treatment of classes 27. For the purpose of a separate class meeting, the Directors may treat two or more of all classes of Shares as forming one class if they consider that such class of Shares would be affected in the same way by the proposals under consideration. Effect of Share issue on class rights 28. The rights conferred upon the holders of any Shares shall not, unless otherwise expressly provided in the rights attaching to such Shares, be deemed to be altered by the creation or issue of further Shares ranking pari passu therewith. NON-RECOGNITION OF TRUSTS 29. Except as required by the Law or these Articles, or under an order of a court of competent jurisdiction, the Company shall not be bound by or compelled to recognise in any way, even when notice thereof is given to it, any equitable, contingent, future or partial interest in any Share, or any other rights in respect of any Share other than an absolute right to the entirety thereof in the registered holder. 9 LIEN Lien generally 30. The Company shall have a first and paramount lien on every Share (not being a fully paid Share) for all moneys (whether presently payable or not) called or payable at a date fixed by or in accordance with the terms of issue of such Share in respect of that Share, and the Company shall also have a first and paramount lien on every Share (other than a fully paid up Share) standing registered in the name of a Member, whether singly or jointly with any other person for all debts and liabilities of a Member or his estate to the Company, whether the same shall have been incurred before or after notice to the Company of any interest of any person other than such Member, and whether the time for the payment or discharge of the same shall have actually arrived or not, and notwithstanding that the same are joint debts or liabilities of such Member or his estate and any other person, whether a Member or not. The Directors may at any time, either generally or in any particular case, waive any lien that has arisen or declare any Share to be wholly or in part exempt from the provisions of this Article. The Company's lien, if any, on a Share shall extTermination to all dividTerminations payable thereon. Enforcement 31. The Company may sell, in such manner as the Directors think fit, any Share on which the Company has a lien, provided a sum in respect of which the lien exists is presently payable, and is not paid within fourteen days after a notice in writing has been given to the registered holder  for the time being of the Share, demanding payment of the sum presently payable and giving notice of the intention to sell in default of such payment. Completion of sale 32. For giving effect to any such sale, the Directors may authorise any person to Assignment the Share sold to the purchaser thereof. The purchaser shall be registered as the holder of the Share comprised in any such Assignment and he shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money, nor shall his title to the Share be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings relating to the sale. Application of proceeds 33. The net proceeds of such sale shall be applied in payment or discharge of the debt or liability in respect of which the lien exists and as is presently payable, and any balance shall (subject to a like lien for debts or liabilities not presently payable as existed upon the Shares prior to the sale) be paid to the person who was the registered holder of the Share immediately before such sale. CALLS ON SHARES Calls on Shares generally 34. The Directors may from time to time make calls upon the Members in respect of any moneys unpaid on their Shares (whether in respect of the par value of the Shares or premium or otherwise and not, by the terms of issue thereof, made payable at a future date fixed by or in accordance with such terms of issue); and each Member shall (subject to the Company serving upon him at least 14 days’ notice specifying the time or times and place of payment) pay to the Company at the time or times and place so specified the amount called on his Shares. A call may be revoked or postponed by the Directors wholly or in part as the Directors may determine. A call shall be deemed to have been made at the time when the resolution of the Directors authorising the call was passed. 10 Payment 35. Payment of a call may be made by instalments on the direction of the Directors. 36. If a sum called in respect of a Share is not paid before or on the day appointed for payment thereof, the person from whom the sum is due shall pay interest on the sum from the day payment is due to the time of the actual payment at such rate as the Directors may determine, but the Directors may waive payment of such interest wholly or in part. 37. Any sum payable in respect of a Share on issue or allotment or at any fixed date, whether in respect of the par value of the Share or premium or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a call and if it is not paid all the relevant provisions as to payment of interest, forfeiture or otherwise of these Articles shall apply as if such sum had become due and payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified. 38. The Directors may issue Shares with different terms as to the amount and times of payment of calls. Liability of joint holders 39. The joint holders of a Share shall be jointly and severally liable to pay calls in respect thereof. Interest 40. The Directors may, if they think fit, receive from any Member willing to advance the same, all or any part of the moneys uncalled and unpaid upon any Shares held by him; and may (until the amount would otherwise become payable) pay interest at such rate (not exceeding six per cent without the sanction of the Company in general meeting) as may be agreed upon between the Member paying the sum in advance and the Directors. FORFEITURE OF SHARES Notice 41. If a Member fails to pay any call or instalment of a call by the date it becomes due and payable, the Directors may, at any time thereafter while such call or instalment remains unpaid, give notice to the Member requiring payment of the unpaid portion of the call or instalment, together with any accrued interest and expenses incurred by the Company by reason of such non-payment. 11 42. The notice shall specify where and by what date (not being less than the Termination of 14 days’ from the date of the notice) payment is to be made and shall state that if it is not complied with the Shares in respect of which the call was made will be liable to be forfeited. The Directors may accept the surrTerminationer of any Share liable to be forfeited hereunder and, in such case, references to these Articles to forfeiture shall include surrTerminationer. Forfeiture for non-compliance 43. If such notice is not complied with, any Share in respect of which the notice was given may thereafter, before the payment of all calls or instalments and interest due in respect thereof has been made, be forfeited by a resolution of the Directors. Such forfeiture shall include all dividTerminations declared, other distributions or other monies payable in respect of the forfeited Shares and not paid before the forfeiture. Forfeited Shares 44. A forfeited Share may be sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed of upon such terms and in such manner as the Directors shall think fit, and at any time before a sale, re-allotment or disposition, the forfeiture may be cancelled on such terms as the Directors think fit. Continued liability for forfeited Member 45. A person whose Shares have been forfeited shall cease to be a Member in respect of the forfeited Shares, but shall remain liable to pay to the Company all moneys which at the date of forfeiture were presently payable by him in respect of the Shares together with interest at such rate as the Directors may determine from the date of forfeiture until payment, but his liability shall cease if and when the Company receives payment in full of all amounts due in respect of the Shares. The Company may enforce payment without being under any obligation to make any allowance for the value of the Shares forfeited. Evidence of forfeiture 46. An affidavit in writing by a Director or Secretary of the Company that a Share has been duly forfeited on a specified date, shall be conclusive evidence of the facts stated in it as against all persons claiming to be entitled to the Share. The Company may receive the consideration, if any, given for the Share on any sale, re-allotment or disposition thereof and may authorise some person to execute a Assignment of the Share in favour of the person to whom the Share is sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed of, and he shall thereupon be registered as the holder of the Share, and shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money (if any) nor shall his title to the Share be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings in reference to the forfeiture, sale, re-allotment or disposition of the Share. 12 47. The provisions of these Articles as to forfeiture shall apply in the case of non-payment of any sum which, by the terms of issue of a Share, becomes payable at a fixed time, whether on account of the par value of the Share, or by way of premium or otherwise, as if the same had been made payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified to the Member. INCREASE OF CAPITAL 48. The Company may from time to time by Ordinary Resolution increase its share capital by such sum, to be divided into new Shares of such par value, and with such rights, priorities and privileges attached thereto as the resolution shall prescribe. 49. Subject to any directions given by the Company in a general meeting, all new Shares shall be at the disposal of the Directors in accordance with these Articles. 50. The new Shares shall be subject to the same provisions of these Articles with reference to the payment of calls, lien, forfeiture, Assignment, transmission and otherwise, as the Shares in the original share capital. ALTERATION OF CAPITAL 51. The Company may from time to time by Ordinary Resolution: 51.1 consolidate and divide all or any of its share capital into Shares of larger par value than its existing Shares; 51.2 sub divide its existing Shares, or any of them, into Shares of smaller par value than is fixed by the Memorandum, subject nevertheless to the provisions of section 13 of the Law; 51.3 cancel any Shares which, at the date of the passing of the resolution, have not been taken or agreed to be taken by any person; and 51.4 convert all or any paid up Shares into stock, and reconvert all or any stock into paid up Shares of any denomination. 52. The Company may from time to time by Special Resolution: 52.1 divide its Shares into several classes and attach to such classes any preferential, deferred, or special rights or restrictions in accordance with these Articles; 52.2 change the currency denomination of its share capital; 13 52.3 reduce its share capital and any capital redemption reserve fund in any manner whatsoever; and 52.4 merge or consolidate with any one or more constituent companies (as defined in the Law). GENERAL MEETINGS Convening a meeting 53. The Directors may, whenever they think fit, convene an extraordinary general meeting. If at any time there are not sufficient Directors capable of acting to form a quorum, any Director, or any one or more Members holding in the aggregate not less than one third of the total issued share capital of the Company entitled to vote, may convene an extraordinary general meeting in the same manner as nearly as possible as that in which meetings may be convened by the Directors. Members’ requisition 54. The Directors shall, upon the requisition in writing of one or more Members holding in the aggregate not less than one tenth of such paid up capital of the Company as at the date of the requisition carries the right of voting at general meetings, convene an extraordinary general meeting. Any such requisition shall express the object of the meeting proposed to be called, and must be signed by the requisitionists and deposited at the Registered Office, and may consist of several documents in like form, each signed by one or more requisitionists. 55. If there are no Directors as at the date of the deposit of the Members’ requisition or if the Directors do not convene a general meeting within 21 days from the date of the deposit, the requisitionists or any or any of them or any other Member or Members holding in the aggregate not less than one tenth of such paid up capital of the Company as at the date of the requisition, may convene an extraordinary general meeting. A general meeting convened by requisitionists shall be convened in the same manner as nearly as possible as that in which general meetings are to be convened by the Directors. NOTICE OF GENERAL MEETINGS Length and form of notice 56. At least five clear days’ notice shall be given of any general meeting. Every notice shall specify the place, the day and the time of meeting and, in the case of special business, the general nature of the business to be conducted at the general meeting, and shall be given in the manner provided in these Articles or in such other manner (if any) as may be prescribed by the Company, to such persons as are entitled to receive such notices from the Company. A general meeting may be convened by such shorter notice, or without notice, by a majority in number of the Members having the right to attTermination and vote at the meeting, being a majority together holding not less than ninety-five percent in nominal value of the Shares giving that right. 14 Omission or non-receipt 57. The accidental omission to give notice of a meeting to, or the non-receipt of a notice of a meeting by, any Member entitled to receive notice shall not invalidate the proceedings at any meeting. PROCEEDINGS AT GENERAL MEETINGS 58. All business shall be deemed special that is transacted at an extraordinary general meeting. Quorum 59. No business shall be transacted at any general meeting unless a quorum of Members is present at the time that the meeting proceeds to business, but the absence of a quorum shall not preclude the appointment, choice or election of a chairman, which shall not be treated as part of the business of the Meeting. Save as herein otherwise provided, one or more Members holding in the aggregate not less than one third of the total issued share capital of the Company present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall be a quorum. Adjournment for lack of quorum 60. If within five minutes (or such longer time as the chairman of the meeting may determine to wait) after the time appointed for the meeting, a quorum is not present, the meeting, if convened upon the requisition of Members, shall be dissolved. In any other case, it shall stand adjourned to the same day in the next week, at the same time and place, and if at the adjourned meeting a quorum is not present within half an hour from the time appointed for the meeting, the Members present shall be a quorum. Meeting by telephone or other facilities 61. A meeting of the Members may be held by telephone, electronic or other communication facilities (including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, by telephone or video conferencing) by which all persons participating in the meeting can communicate with each other simultaneously and instantaneously, and participation in such a general meeting shall constitute presence in person at such meeting. 62. Any Director shall be entitled to attTermination and speak at any general meeting of the Company. 15 Appointment of chairman 63. The chairman (if any) of the Board of Directors shall preside as chairman at every general meeting of the Company. If there is no such chairman, or if at any meeting he is not present within five minutes after the time appointed for holding the meeting or is unwilling to act as chairman, the Directors present shall choose one of their number to act or, if only one Director is present, he shall preside as chairman if willing to act. If no Director is present, or if each of the Directors present declines to take the chair, the Members present and entitled to vote shall elect one of their number to be chairman. Adjournment of meeting 64. The chairman may, with the consent of a meeting at which a quorum is present (and shall if so directed by the meeting) adjourn the meeting from time to time and from place to place, but no business shall be transacted at any adjourned meeting other than the business left unfinished at the meeting from which the adjournment took place. When a meeting is adjourned for ten days or more, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given as in the case of an original meeting. Save as aforesaid, it shall not be necessary to give any notice of an adjournment or of the business to be transacted at an adjourned meeting. VOTING Ordinary Resolution Save where a Special Resolution or other greater majority is required by the Law or these Articles, any question proposed for consideration at any general meeting shall be decided by an Ordinary Resolution. Voting on a show of hands 65. At any general meeting, a resolution put to the vote of the meeting shall be decided on a show of hands, unless before or on the declaration of the result of the show of hands, or on the withdrawal of any other demand for a poll.

No dividTermination shall be paid otherwise than out of profits or out of monies otherwise available for dividTermination in accordance with the Law. Calculation of DividTerminations 136. Subject to the rights of Members, if any, entitled to Shares with special rights as to dividTerminations, all dividTerminations shall be declared and paid according to the amount paid up on the Shares in respect of which the dividTermination is paid and any dividTermination on any class of Shares not fully paid shall be declared and paid according to the amounts paid on the Shares of that class, but if and so long as nothing is paid up on any of the Shares in the Company, dividTerminations may be declared and paid according to the number of Shares. No amount paid on a Share in advance of calls shall, while carrying interest, be treated for the purposes of this Article as paid on the Share.

The Directors may deduct from any dividTermination, distribution or other monies payable to a Member by the Company on or in respect of any Shares all sums of money (if any) presently payable by him to the Company on account of calls or otherwise in respect of Shares of the Company.

Every such cheque or warrant shall, unless the holder or joint holders may in writing direct, be made payable to the order of the person to whom it is sent or to the order of the holder or, in the case of joint holders, to the order of the holder whose name stands first in the Register of Members in respect of such Shares, and shall be sent at his or their risk and payment of the cheque or warrant by the bank on which it is drawn shall constitute a good discharge to the Company. Any one of two or more joint holders may give effectual receipts for any dividTerminations, distributions or other monies payable or property distributable in respect of the Shares held by such joint holders. Satisfaction by distribution of specific assets 140. The Directors may declare that any dividTermination or distribution is paid wholly or partly by the distribution of specific assets and, in particular, of paid up shares, debentures or debenture stock of any other company or in any one or more of such ways, and where any difficulty arises in regard to such dividTermination or distribution, the Directors may settle the same as they think expedient, and in particular may issue fractional Shares or ignore fractions altogether and may fix the value for dividTermination or distribution of such specific assets or any part thereof and may determine that cash payments shall be made to any Members upon the basis of the value so fixed in order to secure equality of distribution, and may vest any such specific assets in trustees as may seem expedient to the Directors. 32 No interest 141. No dividTermination or other distribution or other monies payable by the Company on or in respect of any Share shall bear interest against the Company. Unclaimed dividTerminations 142. All unclaimed dividTerminations or distributions may be invested or otherwise made use of by the Directors for the benefit of the Company until claimed. Any dividTermination or distribution unclaimed by a Member six years after the dividTermination or distribution payment date shall be forfeited and revert to the Company. RESERVES 143. The Directors may, before declaring any dividTermination or distribution, set aside such sums as they think proper as a reserve or reserves which shall, at the discretion of the Directors, be applicable for meeting contingencies, or for equalising dividTerminations, or for any other purpose of the Company, and pTerminationing such application may, in their discretion, be employed in the business of the Company or be invested in such manner as the Directors may from time to time think fit. The Directors may also without placing the same to reserve carry forward any sums which they think it prudent not to distribute. CAPITALISATION OF PROFITS Capitalisation 144. The Directors may capitalise any sum standing to the credit of any of the Company’s reserve accounts which are available for distribution (including its Share Premium Account and capital redemption reserve fund, subject to the Law) or any sum standing to the credit of the profit and loss account or otherwise available for distribution and to appropriate such sums to Members in the proportions in which such sum would have been divisible amongst them had the same been a distribution of profits by way of dividTermination and to apply such sum on their behalf in paying up in full unissued Shares for allotment and distribution credited as fully paid-up to and amongst them in the proportion aforesaid. Authorisation 145. Where any difficulty arises in regard to any distribution under the last preceding Article, the Directors may settle the same as they think expedient and, in particular, may authorise any person to sell and Assignment any fractions or may resolve that the distribution should be as nearly as may be practicable in the correct proportion but not exactly so or may ignore fractions altogether, and may determine that cash payments should be made to any Members in order to adjust the rights of all parties, as may seem expedient to the Directors. The Directors may appoint any person to sign on behalf of the persons entitled to participate in the distribution any contract necessary or desirable for giving effect thereto and such appointment shall be effective and binding upon the Members. 33 SHARE PREMIUM ACCOUNT 146. The Directors shall in accordance with the Law establish a Share Premium Account and shall carry to the credit of such account from time to time a sum equal to the amount or value of the premium paid on the issue of any Share. 147. There shall be debited to any Share Premium Account on the redemption or purchase of a Share the difference between the nominal value of such Share and the redemption or purchase price provided always that at the discretion of the Directors such sum may be paid out of the profits of the Company or, if permitted by the Law, out of capital. ACCOUNTING RECORDS Books of account 148. The Directors shall cause to be kept accounting records sufficient to give a true and fair view of the state of the Company's affairs and to show and explain its transactions and otherwise in accordance with the Law. Inspection by Members 149. The accounting records shall be kept at the Registered Office or at such other place or places as the Directors think fit, and shall at all times be open to inspection by the Directors. No Member (who is not also a Director) shall have any right to inspect any accounting record or book or document of the Company except as conferred by law or authorised by the Directors or by the Members by Ordinary Resolution. Records and audit 150. From time to time the Company in general meeting may determine (or revoke, alter or amTermination any such determination) or, failing such determination, the Directors may determine (or revoke, alter or amTermination any such determination): 150.1 that the accounts of the Company be audited and the appointment of the Auditors; 150.2 that there be prepared and sent to each Member and other person entitled thereto a profit and loss account, a balance sheet, group accounts and/or reports for such period and on such terms as they may determine; and 150.3 that there be laid before the Company in general meeting a copy of every balance sheet together with a copy of the Auditor's report. 34 SERVICE OF NOTICES AND DOCUMENTS Form and delivery of notices 151. Notices or other documents or communications may be given to any Member by the Company either personally or by sTerminationing it by courier, post, fax or email to him to his registered address, or (if he has no registered address) to the address, if any, supplied by him to the Company for the giving of notices to him. Any notice shall be deemed to be effected: 151.1 if delivered personally or sent by courier, by properly addressing and prepaying a letter containing the notice; and to have been effected, in the case of a notice of a meeting, when delivered; 151.2 if sent by post, by properly addressing, prepaying, and posting a letter containing the notice (by airmail if available) and to have been effected, in the case of a notice of a meeting, at the Termination of three days after it was posted; and 151.3 if sent by fax or email by properly addressing and sTerminationing such notice through the appropriate transmitting medium and to have been effected on the day the same is sent. 152. A notice may be given by the Company to the joint holders of a Share by giving the notice to the joint holder named first in the Register of Members in respect of the Share. 153. A notice may be given by the Company to the person entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a Member by sTerminationing it through the post in a prepaid letter addressed to them by name, or by the title of representatives of the deceased, or trustee of the bankrupt, or by any like description, at the address, if any, supplied for the purpose by the persons claiming to be so entitled, or (until such an address has been so supplied) by giving the notice in any manner in which the same might have been given if the death or bankruptcy had not occurred. 154. Notice of every general meeting shall be given in any manner hereinbefore authorised to: 154.1 every Member entitled to vote except those Members entitled to vote who (having no registered address) have not supplied to the Company an address for the giving of notices to them; and 154.2 every person entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a Member, who, but for his death or bankruptcy would be entitled to receive notice of the meeting. 155. No other persons shall be entitled to receive notices of general meeting. 35 WINDING UP Method of winding up 156. Subject to the rights attaching to any Shares, if the Company shall be wound up, the liquidator may, with the sanction of a Special Resolution and any other sanction required by the Law or these Articles, divide amongst the Members in kind the whole or any part of the assets of the Company (whether they shall consist of property of the same kind or not) and may for such purpose set such value as he deems fair upon any property to be divided as aforesaid and may determine how such division shall be carried out as between the Members or different classes of Members. The liquidator may, with the like sanction, vest the whole or any part of such assets in trustees upon such trusts for the benefit of the contributories as the liquidator, with the like sanction, shall think fit, but so that no Member shall be compelled to accept any asset upon which there is any liability. Distribution of assets 157. If the Company shall be wound up and the assets available for distribution amongst the Members as such shall be insufficient to repay the whole of the paid up capital, such assets shall be distributed so that, as nearly as may be, the losses shall be borne by the Members in proportion to the capital paid up, or which ought to have been paid up, at the commencement of the winding up, on the Shares held by them respectively. And if in a winding up the assets available for distribution amongst the Members shall be more than sufficient to repay the whole of the capital paid up at the commencement of the winding up, the excess shall be distributed amongst the Members in proportion to the capital paid up at the commencement of the winding up on the Shares held by them respectively. This Article is to be without prejudice to the rights of the holders of Shares issued upon special terms and conditions. Indemnification Indemnification and limitation of liability 158. Every Indemnified Person shall, in the absence of wilful neglect or default, be indemnified and held harmless out of the assets of the Company against all liabilities, loss, damage, cost or expense (including but not limited to liabilities under contract, tort and statute or any applicable foreign law or regulation and all reasonable legal and other costs and expenses on a full Indemnification basis properly payable) incurred or suffered by him by or by reason of any act done, conceived in or omitted in the conduct of the Company’s business or in the discharge of his duties and the Indemnification contained in this Article shall extTermination to any Indemnified Person acting in any office or trust in the reasonable belief that he has been appointed or elected to such office or trust notwithstanding any defect in such appointment or election. 36 159. No Indemnified Person shall be liable to the Company for acts, defaults or omissions of any other Indemnified Person. Indemnification and reimbursement 160. Every Indemnified Person shall be indemnified out of the funds of the Company against all liabilities incurred by him by or by reason of any act done, conceived in or omitted in the conduct of the Company’s business or in the discharge of his duties in defTerminationing any proceedings, whether civil or criminal, in which judgment is given in his favour, or in which he is acquitted, or in connection with any application in which relief from liability is granted to him by the court. 161. To the extent that any Indemnified Person is entitled to claim an Indemnification pursuant to these Articles in respect of amounts paid or discharged by him, the relative Indemnification shall take effect as an obligation of the Company to reimburse the person making such payment or effecting such discharge. Wilful neglect or default 162. Each Member and the Company agree to waive any claim or right of action he or it may at any time have, whether individually or by or in the right of the Company, against any Indemnified Person on account of any act or omission of such Indemnified Person in the performance of his duties for the Company; provided however, that such waiver shall not apply to any claims or rights of action arising out of the wilful neglect or default of such Indemnified Person or to recover any gain, personal profit or advantage to which such Indemnified Person is not legally entitled. Advance of legal fees 163. Expenses incurred in defTerminationing any civil or criminal action or proceeding for which indemnification is required pursuant to these Articles shall be paid by the Company in advance of the final disposition of such action or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnified Person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that the Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified pursuant to these Articles. Each Member of the Company shall be deemed to have acknowledged and agreed that the advances of funds may be made by the Company as aforesaid, and when made by the Company under this Article are made to meet expTerminationitures incurred for the purpose of enabling such Indemnified Person to properly perform his or her duties to the Company. 37 CONTINUATION 164. The Company shall have the power, subject to the provisions of the Law and with the approval of a Special Resolution, to continue as a body incorporated under the laws of any jurisdiction outside of the Cayman Islands and to be de-registered in the Cayman Islands. AMTerminationMENT OF MEMORANDUM AND ARTICLES Subject to the provisions of the Law, the Company may from time to time by Special Resolution alter or amTermination the Memorandum or these Articles in whole or in part provided that no such amTerminationment shall affect the special rights attaching to any class of Shares without the consent or sanction provided for in these Articles. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Memorandum or in these Articles or in Law, for so long as HLNG is a Member, the Company shall not alter or amTermination the Memorandum or these Articles in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of HLNG 38 SCHEDULE A INSURANCE POLICIES Hull & Material Adverse Effecthinery insurance: All insurances carried, or to be carried, by the owner of the Vessel are placed as part of Höegh LNG’s fleet placements in the international insurance markets.

Every Member shall be entitled, without payment, to a certificate of the Company specifying the Share or Shares held by him and the amount paid up thereon. 13. Notwithstanding the provisions of these Articles, the Directors may resolve not to issue share certificates to Members of the Company. Certificates for jointly-held Shares 14. The Company shall not be bound to issue more than one certificate for Shares held jointly by more than one person, and delivery of a certificate to one joint holder shall be sufficient delivery to all. Replacement Share Certificates 15. If a share certificate is defaced, lost or destroyed, it may be replaced on payment of such fee (if any) and on such terms (if any) as to evidence and Indemnification, and on the payment of expenses of the Company in investigating such evidence and preparing such Indemnification as the Directors shall think fit and, in case of defacement, on delivery of the old certificate to the Company for cancellation. 6 Assignment OF SHARES Instrument of Assignment 16. The instrument of Assignment of any Share shall be executed by or on behalf of the Assignmentor (and, if the Directors so determine, the Assignmentee).

All instruments of Assignment, once registered, may be retained by the Company. 17. Subject to any applicable restrictions contained in these Articles, Shares shall be Assignmentred in any usual or common form approved by the Directors. Refusal to register Assignments 18. The Directors may, in their absolute discretion and without assigning any reason therefore, decline to register any Assignment of any Share.

If the Directors decline to register a Assignment of Shares they shall sTermination notice of the refusal to the Assignmentee within one month after the date on which the Assignment was lodged with the Company. 20. The Directors may also suspTermination the registration of the Assignments at such times and for such periods as the Directors may from time to time determine. TRANSMISSION OF SHARES Transmission of Shares 21. If a Member dies, the survivor or survivors (where he was a joint holder), and the legal personal representative (where he was sole holder), shall be the only person recognised by the Company as having any title to the Share. The estate of a deceased Member is not thereby released from any liability in respect of any Share held by him, whether solely or jointly. For the purpose of this Article, legal personal representative means the person to whom probate or letters of administration has or have been granted in the Cayman Islands or, if there is no such person, such other person as the Directors may in their absolute discretion determine to be the person recognised by the Company for the purpose of this Article. Election by persons entitled on transmission 22. Any person becoming entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a Member or otherwise by operation of Governing Law may elect, upon such evidence being produced as may be required by the Directors as to his entitlement, either be registered himself as a Member in respect of the Share or, instead of being registered himself, to make such Assignment of the Share as the deceased or bankrupt Member could have made. 7 Manner of election 23. If the person so becoming entitled elects to be registered himself, he shall deliver or sTermination to the Company a notice in writing signed by him stating that he so elects. If he shall elect to Assignment the Shares, he shall signify his election by signing an instrument of Assignment of such Shares in favour of his Assignmentee. All the limitations, restrictions and provisions of these Articles relating to the right to Assignment and the registration of Assignments of Shares shall be applicable to any such notice or instrument of Assignment as aforesaid as if the death of the Member or other event giving rise to the transmission had not occurred and the notice or instrument of Assignment was an instrument of Assignment signed by such Member. Rights of persons entitled on transmission 24. A person becoming entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of the Member (or otherwise by operation of Governing Law), upon such evidence being produced as may be required by the Directors as to his entitlement, shall be entitled to the same dividTerminations and other monies payable in respect of the Share as he would be entitled if he were the holder of such Share. However, he shall not be entitled, until he becomes registered as the holder of such Share, to receive notices of or to attTermination or vote at general meetings of the Company or (except as aforesaid) to exercise any other rights or privileges of a Member. The Directors may at any time give notice requiring such person to elect either to be registered himself or to Assignment the Share and, if the notice is not complied with within sixty days, the Directors may thereafter withhold payment of all dividTerminations and other monies payable in respect of the Shares until the requirements of the notice have been complied with. REDEMPTION AND PURCHASE OF SHARES 25. Subject to the provisions of the Law and the Memorandum, the Company may: 25.1 purchase its own Shares (including any redeemable Shares) in such manner and on such terms as the Directors may agree with the relevant Member unless following such purchase there would no longer be any issued Shares and may make payment for such purchase or for any redemption of Shares in any manner authorised by the Law, including out of capital; and 25.2 reduce its share capital and any capital redemption reserve fund in any manner whatsoever. 8 VARIATION OF SHARE RIGHTS Variation of class rights 26. If at any time the share capital is divided into different classes of Shares, all or any of the special rights attached to any class of Shares (unless otherwise provided by the terms of issue of the Shares of that class) may be varied or abrogated with the consent in writing of the holders of not less than two thirds of the issued Shares of that class or with the sanction of a resolution passed by the holders of not less than two thirds of the issued Shares of that class as may be present in person or by proxy at a separate general meeting of the holders of the Shares of that class. To any such separate general meeting, all of the provisions of these Articles relating to general meetings shall mutatis mutandis apply, but so that the necessary quorum shall be any one or more persons holding or representing by proxy not less than one third of the issued Shares of the class and that any holder of Shares of the relevant class present in person or by proxy may demand a poll. Treatment of classes 27. For the purpose of a separate class meeting, the Directors may treat two or more of all classes of Shares as forming one class if they consider that such class of Shares would be affected in the same way by the proposals under consideration. Effect of Share issue on class rights 28. The rights conferred upon the holders of any Shares shall not, unless otherwise expressly provided in the rights attaching to such Shares, be deemed to be altered by the creation or issue of further Shares ranking pari passu therewith. NON-RECOGNITION OF TRUSTS 29. Except as required by the Law or these Articles, or under an order of a court of competent jurisdiction, the Company shall not be bound by or compelled to recognise in any way, even when notice thereof is given to it, any equitable, contingent, future or partial interest in any Share, or any other rights in respect of any Share other than an absolute right to the entirety thereof in the registered holder. 9 LIEN Lien generally 30. The Company shall have a first and paramount lien on every Share (not being a fully paid Share) for all moneys (whether presently payable or not) called or payable at a date fixed by or in accordance with the terms of issue of such Share in respect of that Share, and the Company shall also have a first and paramount lien on every Share (other than a fully paid up Share) standing registered in the name of a Member, whether singly or jointly with any other person for all debts and liabilities of a Member or his estate to the Company, whether the same shall have been incurred before or after notice to the Company of any interest of any person other than such Member, and whether the time for the payment or discharge of the same shall have actually arrived or not, and notwithstanding that the same are joint debts or liabilities of such Member or his estate and any other person, whether a Member or not. The Directors may at any time, either generally or in any particular case, waive any lien that has arisen or declare any Share to be wholly or in part exempt from the provisions of this Article. The Company's lien, if any, on a Share shall extTermination to all dividTerminations payable thereon. Enforcement 31. The Company may sell, in such manner as the Directors think fit, any Share on which the Company has a lien, provided a sum in respect of which the lien exists is presently payable, and is not paid within fourteen days after a notice in writing has been given to the registered holder  for the time being of the Share, demanding payment of the sum presently payable and giving notice of the intention to sell in default of such payment. Completion of sale 32. For giving effect to any such sale, the Directors may authorise any person to Assignment the Share sold to the purchaser thereof. The purchaser shall be registered as the holder of the Share comprised in any such Assignment and he shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money, nor shall his title to the Share be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings relating to the sale. Application of proceeds 33. The net proceeds of such sale shall be applied in payment or discharge of the debt or liability in respect of which the lien exists and as is presently payable, and any balance shall (subject to a like lien for debts or liabilities not presently payable as existed upon the Shares prior to the sale) be paid to the person who was the registered holder of the Share immediately before such sale. CALLS ON SHARES Calls on Shares generally 34. The Directors may from time to time make calls upon the Members in respect of any moneys unpaid on their Shares (whether in respect of the par value of the Shares or premium or otherwise and not, by the terms of issue thereof, made payable at a future date fixed by or in accordance with such terms of issue); and each Member shall (subject to the Company serving upon him at least 14 days’ notice specifying the time or times and place of payment) pay to the Company at the time or times and place so specified the amount called on his Shares. A call may be revoked or postponed by the Directors wholly or in part as the Directors may determine. A call shall be deemed to have been made at the time when the resolution of the Directors authorising the call was passed. 10 Payment 35. Payment of a call may be made by instalments on the direction of the Directors. 36. If a sum called in respect of a Share is not paid before or on the day appointed for payment thereof, the person from whom the sum is due shall pay interest on the sum from the day payment is due to the time of the actual payment at such rate as the Directors may determine, but the Directors may waive payment of such interest wholly or in part. 37. Any sum payable in respect of a Share on issue or allotment or at any fixed date, whether in respect of the par value of the Share or premium or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a call and if it is not paid all the relevant provisions as to payment of interest, forfeiture or otherwise of these Articles shall apply as if such sum had become due and payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified. 38. The Directors may issue Shares with different terms as to the amount and times of payment of calls. Liability of joint holders 39. The joint holders of a Share shall be jointly and severally liable to pay calls in respect thereof. Interest 40. The Directors may, if they think fit, receive from any Member willing to advance the same, all or any part of the moneys uncalled and unpaid upon any Shares held by him; and may (until the amount would otherwise become payable) pay interest at such rate (not exceeding six per cent without the sanction of the Company in general meeting) as may be agreed upon between the Member paying the sum in advance and the Directors. FORFEITURE OF SHARES Notice 41. If a Member fails to pay any call or instalment of a call by the date it becomes due and payable, the Directors may, at any time thereafter while such call or instalment remains unpaid, give notice to the Member requiring payment of the unpaid portion of the call or instalment, together with any accrued interest and expenses incurred by the Company by reason of such non-payment. 11 42. The notice shall specify where and by what date (not being less than the Termination of 14 days’ from the date of the notice) payment is to be made and shall state that if it is not complied with the Shares in respect of which the call was made will be liable to be forfeited. The Directors may accept the surrTerminationer of any Share liable to be forfeited hereunder and, in such case, references to these Articles to forfeiture shall include surrTerminationer. Forfeiture for non-compliance 43. If such notice is not complied with, any Share in respect of which the notice was given may thereafter, before the payment of all calls or instalments and interest due in respect thereof has been made, be forfeited by a resolution of the Directors. Such forfeiture shall include all dividTerminations declared, other distributions or other monies payable in respect of the forfeited Shares and not paid before the forfeiture. Forfeited Shares 44. A forfeited Share may be sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed of upon such terms and in such manner as the Directors shall think fit, and at any time before a sale, re-allotment or disposition, the forfeiture may be cancelled on such terms as the Directors think fit. Continued liability for forfeited Member 45. A person whose Shares have been forfeited shall cease to be a Member in respect of the forfeited Shares, but shall remain liable to pay to the Company all moneys which at the date of forfeiture were presently payable by him in respect of the Shares together with interest at such rate as the Directors may determine from the date of forfeiture until payment, but his liability shall cease if and when the Company receives payment in full of all amounts due in respect of the Shares. The Company may enforce payment without being under any obligation to make any allowance for the value of the Shares forfeited. Evidence of forfeiture 46. An affidavit in writing by a Director or Secretary of the Company that a Share has been duly forfeited on a specified date, shall be conclusive evidence of the facts stated in it as against all persons claiming to be entitled to the Share. The Company may receive the consideration, if any, given for the Share on any sale, re-allotment or disposition thereof and may authorise some person to execute a Assignment of the Share in favour of the person to whom the Share is sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed of, and he shall thereupon be registered as the holder of the Share, and shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money (if any) nor shall his title to the Share be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings in reference to the forfeiture, sale, re-allotment or disposition of the Share. 12 47. The provisions of these Articles as to forfeiture shall apply in the case of non-payment of any sum which, by the terms of issue of a Share, becomes payable at a fixed time, whether on account of the par value of the Share, or by way of premium or otherwise, as if the same had been made payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified to the Member. INCREASE OF CAPITAL 48. The Company may from time to time by Ordinary Resolution increase its share capital by such sum, to be divided into new Shares of such par value, and with such rights, priorities and privileges attached thereto as the resolution shall prescribe. 49. Subject to any directions given by the Company in a general meeting, all new Shares shall be at the disposal of the Directors in accordance with these Articles. 50. The new Shares shall be subject to the same provisions of these Articles with reference to the payment of calls, lien, forfeiture, Assignment, transmission and otherwise, as the Shares in the original share capital. ALTERATION OF CAPITAL 51. The Company may from time to time by Ordinary Resolution: 51.1 consolidate and divide all or any of its share capital into Shares of larger par value than its existing Shares; 51.2 sub divide its existing Shares, or any of them, into Shares of smaller par value than is fixed by the Memorandum, subject nevertheless to the provisions of section 13 of the Law; 51.3 cancel any Shares which, at the date of the passing of the resolution, have not been taken or agreed to be taken by any person; and 51.4 convert all or any paid up Shares into stock, and reconvert all or any stock into paid up Shares of any denomination. 52. The Company may from time to time by Special Resolution: 52.1 divide its Shares into several classes and attach to such classes any preferential, deferred, or special rights or restrictions in accordance with these Articles; 52.2 change the currency denomination of its share capital; 13 52.3 reduce its share capital and any capital redemption reserve fund in any manner whatsoever; and 52.4 merge or consolidate with any one or more constituent companies (as defined in the Law). GENERAL MEETINGS Convening a meeting 53. The Directors may, whenever they think fit, convene an extraordinary general meeting. If at any time there are not sufficient Directors capable of acting to form a quorum, any Director, or any one or more Members holding in the aggregate not less than one third of the total issued share capital of the Company entitled to vote, may convene an extraordinary general meeting in the same manner as nearly as possible as that in which meetings may be convened by the Directors. Members’ requisition 54. The Directors shall, upon the requisition in writing of one or more Members holding in the aggregate not less than one tenth of such paid up capital of the Company as at the date of the requisition carries the right of voting at general meetings, convene an extraordinary general meeting. Any such requisition shall express the object of the meeting proposed to be called, and must be signed by the requisitionists and deposited at the Registered Office, and may consist of several documents in like form, each signed by one or more requisitionists. 55.

Every notice shall specify the place, the day and the time of meeting and, in the case of special business, the general nature of the business to be conducted at the general meeting, and shall be given in the manner provided in these Articles or in such other manner (if any) as may be prescribed by the Company, to such persons as are entitled to receive such notices from the Company. A general meeting may be convened by such shorter notice, or without notice, by a majority in number of the Members having the right to attTermination and vote at the meeting, being a majority together holding not less than ninety-five percent in nominal value of the Shares giving that right. 14 Omission or non-receipt 57.

PROCEEDINGS AT GENERAL MEETINGS 58. All business shall be deemed special that is transacted at an extraordinary general meeting. Quorum 59. No business shall be transacted at any general meeting unless a quorum of Members is present at the time that the meeting proceeds to business, but the absence of a quorum shall not preclude the appointment, choice or election of a chairman, which shall not be treated as part of the business of the Meeting. Save as herein otherwise provided, one or more Members holding in the aggregate not less than one third of the total issued share capital of the Company present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall be a quorum. Adjournment for lack of quorum 60. If within five minutes (or such longer time as the chairman of the meeting may determine to wait) after the time appointed for the meeting, a quorum is not present, the meeting, if convened upon the requisition of Members, shall be dissolved. In any other case, it shall stand adjourned to the same day in the next week, at the same time and place, and if at the adjourned meeting a quorum is not present within half an hour from the time appointed for the meeting, the Members present shall be a quorum. Meeting by telephone or other facilities 61. A meeting of the Members may be held by telephone, electronic or other communication facilities (including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, by telephone or video conferencing) by which all persons participating in the meeting can communicate with each other simultaneously and instantaneously, and participation in such a general meeting shall constitute presence in person at such meeting. 62. Any Director shall be entitled to attTermination and speak at any general meeting of the Company. 15 Appointment of chairman 63. The chairman (if any) of the Board of Directors shall preside as chairman at every general meeting of the Company.

If no Director is present, or if each of the Directors present declines to take the chair, the Members present and entitled to vote shall elect one of their number to be chairman. Adjournment of meeting 64. The chairman may, with the consent of a meeting at which a quorum is present (and shall if so directed by the meeting) adjourn the meeting from time to time and from place to place, but no business shall be transacted at any adjourned meeting other than the business left unfinished at the meeting from which the adjournment took place. When a meeting is adjourned for ten days or more, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given as in the case of an original meeting. Save as aforesaid, it shall not be necessary to give any notice of an adjournment or of the business to be transacted at an adjourned meeting. VOTING Ordinary Resolution Save where a Special Resolution or other greater majority is required by the Law or these Articles, any question proposed for consideration at any general meeting shall be decided by an Ordinary Resolution. Voting on a show of hands 65. At any general meeting, a resolution put to the vote of the meeting shall be decided on a show of hands, unless before or on the declaration of the result of the show of hands, or on the withdrawal of any other demand for a poll. Demand for poll 66. A poll is demanded by: 66.1 the chairman of the meeting; or 66.2 at least three Members present in person or by proxy; or 66.3 any Member or Members present in person or by proxy and holding collectively not less than one tenth of the total voting rights of all the Members having the right to vote at such meeting; or 16 66.4 a Member or Members present in person or by proxy holding Shares conferring the right to vote at such meeting, being Shares on which an aggregate sum has been paid up equal to not less than one tenth of the total sum paid up on all such Shares conferring such right. 67. Unless a poll is duly demanded and the demand is not withdrawn, a declaration by the chairman that a resolution has, on a show of hands, been carried or carried unanimously, or by a particular majority, or lost and an entry to that effect in the minutes of the proceedings of the Company shall be conclusive evidence of that fact, without proof of the number or proportion of the votes recorded in favour of, or against, that resolution. The demand for a poll may be withdrawn by the person or any persons making it at any time prior to the declaration of the result of the poll. 68. If a poll is duly demanded, it shall be taken in such manner as the chairman directs, and the result of the poll shall be deemed to be the resolution of the meeting at which the poll was demanded. 69. In the case of an equality of votes at a general meeting, whether on a show of hands or on a poll, the chairman of the meeting at which the show of hands takes place or at which the poll is demanded, shall not be entitled to a second or casting vote and the resolution shall fail. 70. A poll demanded on the election of a chairman or on a question of adjournment shall be taken forthwith. A poll demanded on any other question shall be taken in such manner and either forthwith or at such time later in the meeting as the chairman of the meeting shall direct. 71. The demand for a poll shall not prevent the continuance of a meeting for the transaction of any business other than the question on which the poll has been demanded and it may be withdrawn at any time before the close of the meeting or the taking of the poll, whichever is the earlier. Voting on a poll 72. On a poll votes may be cast either personally or by proxy. 73. A person entitled to more than one vote on a poll need not use all his votes or cast all the votes he uses in the same way. 74. On a show of hands, every Member present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall have one vote. On a poll, every Member present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall have one vote for each Share of which he is the registered holder. 17 75. In the case of joint holders of a Share, the vote of the senior who tTerminationers a vote, whether in person or by proxy, shall be accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint holders; and for this purpose seniority shall be determined by the order in which the names stand in the Register of Members in respect of the joint holding. 76. A Member of unsound mind, or, in respect of whom an order has been made by any court having jurisdiction in lunacy, may vote, whether on a show of hands or on a poll, by his receiver, committee, curator bonis or other person of similar nature appointed by such court, and any such receiver, committee, curator bonis or other person may vote by proxy and may otherwise act and be treated as such Member for the purpose of the general meetings. 77. No Member, unless the Directors otherwise determine, shall be entitled to vote at any general meeting, unless all calls or other sums presently payable by him in respect of Shares in the Company have been paid. 78. No objection shall be raised as to the qualification of any voter or as to whether any votes have been properly counted except at the general meeting or adjourned general meeting at which the vote objected to is given or tTerminationered and every vote not disallowed at the meeting shall be valid. Any objection made in due time and in accordance with these Articles shall be referred to the chairman whose decision shall be final and conclusive. Shareholder Restricted Matters 78A.

The Directors may elect a chairman of their meetings and determine the period for which he is to hold office; but if no such chairman is elected, or if at any meeting the chairman is not present within five minutes after the time appointed for holding the same, the Directors present may choose one of their number to be chairman of the meeting. Written resolutions of Directors 109. A resolution in writing signed by all of the Directors or all of the members of a committee of Directors for the time being entitled to receive notice of a meeting of the Directors (or by an alternate Director as provided in these Articles), including a resolution signed in counterpart and/or sent or evidenced by way of signed fax or electronic transmission, shall be as valid and effectual as if it had been passed at a meeting of the Directors or of a committee of Directors duly called and constituted. Meeting by telephone or other facilities 110. To the extent permitted by law, a meeting of the Directors or a committee appointed by the Directors may be held by means of such telephone, electronic or other communication facilities (including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, by telephone or by video conferencing) as permit all persons participating in the meeting to communicate with each other simultaneously and instantaneously and participation in such a meeting shall constitute presence in person at such meeting. Such a meeting shall be deemed to take place where the largest group of those Directors participating in the meeting is physically assembled, or, if there is no such group, where the chairman of the meeting then is. Validity of acts in spite of defect 111. All acts done by any meeting of the Directors or of a committee of Directors, or by any person acting as a Director shall, notwithstanding that it be afterwards discovered that there was some defect in the appointment of any such Director or person acting as aforesaid, or that they or any of them were disqualified, be as valid as if every such person had been duly appointed and was qualified to be a Director. Minutes 112. The Directors shall cause minutes to be made and records kept for the purpose of recording: 26 112.1 all appointments of officers made by the Directors; 112.2 the names of the Directors and other persons present at each meeting of the Directors and of any committee of the Directors; and 112.3 all resolutions and proceedings at all meetings of the Members of the Company or any class of Members and of the Directors and of committees of Directors; and the chairman of all such meetings or of any meeting confirming the minutes thereof shall sign the same. DIRECTORS’ INTERESTS 113. A Director may hold any other office or place of profit with the Company (except that of Auditor) in conjunction with his office of Director for such period and upon such terms as to remuneration and otherwise as the Directors may determine. 114. A Director or officer may act by himself or his firm in a professional capacity for the Company (otherwise than as Auditor), and he or his firm shall be entitled to remuneration for professional services as if he were not a Director or officer. 115. No Director or officer shall be disqualified from his office or prevented by such office from holding any office or place of profit under the Company or under any company in which the Company shall be a Member or have any interest, or from contracting with the Company, either as vTerminationor, purchaser or otherwise, nor shall any such contract or any contract or transaction entered into by or on behalf of the Company in which any Director or officer shall be in any way interested be or be liable to be avoided nor shall any Director or officer so contracting, dealing or being so interested be liable to account to the Company for any profit realised by any such contract or transaction by reason of such Director holding office or of the fiduciary relation thereby established. Disclosure and nature of interest 116. A Director (or his alternate Director in his absence) shall be at liberty to vote in respect of any contract or transaction in which he is interested provided that the nature of the interest of the Director in any such contract or transaction shall be disclosed by him at or prior to its consideration and any vote thereon. 117. The nature of the interest of any Director or officer in any contract, dealing or transacting with or affecting the Company shall be disclosed by him at or prior to its consideration and any vote thereon and a general notice that a Director or officer is a shareholder of any specified firm or company and/or is to be regarded as interested in any transaction with such firm or company shall be sufficient disclosure hereunder and after such general notice it shall not be necessary to give special notice relating to any particular transaction. 27 DELEGATION OF DIRECTORS’ POWERS Power to delegate 118. Directors may from time to time and at any time by power of attorney or otherwise appoint any company, firm or person or fluctuating body of persons, whether nominated directly or indirectly by the Directors, to be the attorney or attorneys of the Company for such purposes and with such powers, authorities and discretions (not exceeding those vested in or exercisable by the Directors under these Articles) and for such period and subject to such conditions as they may think fit, and any such power of attorney may contain such provisions for the protection and convenience of persons dealing with any such attorney and of such attorney as the Directors may think fit and may also authorise any such attorney to delegate all or any of the powers, authorities and discretions vested in him. 119. The Directors may delegate any of the powers exercisable by them to a Managing Director , Director or any other person or persons acting individually or jointly as they may from time to time by resolution appoint upon such terms and conditions and with such restrictions as they may think fit, and may from time to time by resolution revoke, withdraw, alter or vary all or any such powers. Alternate Directors 120. Any Director may by writing appoint any other Director, or other person willing to act, to be his alternate and remove his alternate so appointed by him. Such appointment or removal shall be by notice to the Registered Office signed by the Director making or revoking the appointment or in any other manner approved by the Directors, and shall be effective on the date the notice is served and the alternate shall be notified of such appointment or revocation. Subject to the removal by the appointing Director, the alternate shall continue in office until the date on which his appointor ceases to be a Director. An alternate may also be a Director in his own right and may act as alternate to more than one Director. 121. An alternate shall be entitled to receive notice of all meetings of the Directors, attTermination, be counted in the quorum, vote and act in such appointor’s place at every such meeting at which the appointing Director is not personally present, and generally to perform all the functions of his appointor as a Director in his absence. 122. These Articles (except as regards powers to appoint an alternate and remuneration) apply equally to the alternate as though he were the Director in his own right. 123. An alternate Director shall be deemed for all purposes to be a Director and shall alone be responsible for his own acts and defaults and shall not be deemed to be the agent of the Director appointing him. The signature of an alternate to any resolution in writing of the Director or a committee there shall, unless the terms of the appointment provides to the contrary, be as effective as the signature of the Director or Directors to whom he is alternate. 28 Committees of Directors 124. The Directors may delegate any of their powers to committees consisting of such member or members of their body as they think fit; any committee so formed shall, in the exercise of the powers so delegated, conform to any regulations that may be imposed on it by the Directors. 125. A committee may elect a chairman of its meetings; if no such chairman is elected, or if at any meeting the chairman is not present within five minutes after the time appointed for holding the same, the members present may choose one of their number to be chairman of the meeting. 126. A committee may meet and adjourn as it thinks proper. Questions arising at any meeting shall be determined by a majority of votes of the members present and in case of an equality of votes the chairman shall not have a second or casting vote and the motion shall be deemed to have been lost. Officers 127. The Directors may appoint a Secretary and such other officers as they may from time to time consider necessary upon such terms as to duration of office, remuneration and otherwise as they may think fit. Such Secretary or other officers need not be Directors and in the case of the other officers may be ascribed such titles as the Directors may decide and the Directors may revoke or terminate any such election or appointment. Any such revocation or termination shall be without prejudice to any claim for any damages that such officer may have against the Company or the Company may have against such officer for any breach of any contract of service between him and the Company which may be involved in such revocation or termination. Save as provided in the Law or these Articles, the powers and duties of the officers of the Company shall be such (if any) as are determined from time to time by the Directors. DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION Remuneration 128. The remuneration to be paid to the Directors, if any, shall be determined by the Company in general meeting or, in the absence of such a determination, by the Directors. Expenses 129. Each Director shall also be entitled to be paid his reasonable travelling, hotel and other expenses properly incurred by him in connection with his attTerminationance at meetings of the Directors, committees of the Directors or general meetings of the Company, or otherwise in connection with the business of the Company, or to receive a fixed allowance in respect thereof as may be determined by the Directors, or a combination partly of one such method and partly the other. 29 Additional remuneration 130. The Directors may by resolution approve additional remuneration to any Director for services which in the opinion of the Directors go beyond the ordinary duties of a Director, and such extra remuneration shall be in addition to any remuneration provided for, by or pursuant to any other Article. SEALS AND DEEDS Use of Seal 131. The Directors may determine that the Company shall have a Seal, and if they so determine, shall provide for the safe custody of the Seal. The Seal shall only be used by the authority of the Directors and in the presence of a Director or the Secretary or such other person as the Directors may by resolution appoint for this purpose, and every instrument to which the Seal affixed shall be signed by the relevant person. Notwithstanding the above, annual returns and notices filed under the Law may be executed either as a deed or under Seal and in either case without the need for the authority of a resolution of the Directors. 30 Duplicate Seal 132. The Company may maintain in any place or places outside the Cayman Islands a facsimile of any Seal and such facsimile seal shall be affixed in the same way as if it were the Seal. Execution of deeds 133. In accordance with the Law, the Company may execute any deed or other instrument (which would otherwise be required to be executed under Seal) by the signature of such deed or instrument as a deed by a Director or by the Secretary of the Company or by such other person as the Directors may appoint or by any other person or attorney on behalf of the Company appointed by a deed or other instrument executed as a deed by a Director or the Secretary or such other person as aforesaid. DIVIDTerminationS Payment of DividTerminations 134. The Directors may from time to time declare dividTerminations to be paid to the Members according to their rights and interests, including such interim dividTerminations as appear to the Directors to be justified by the position of the Company. The Directors may also pay any fixed cash dividTermination which is payable on any Shares of the Company half yearly or on such other dates, whenever the position of the Company, in the opinion of the Directors, justifies such payment. 135. No dividTermination shall be paid otherwise than out of profits or out of monies otherwise available for dividTermination in accordance with the Law. Calculation of DividTerminations 136. Subject to the rights of Members, if any, entitled to Shares with special rights as to dividTerminations, all dividTerminations shall be declared and paid according to the amount paid up on the Shares in respect of which the dividTermination is paid and any dividTermination on any class of Shares not fully paid shall be declared and paid according to the amounts paid on the Shares of that class, but if and so long as nothing is paid up on any of the Shares in the Company, dividTerminations may be declared and paid according to the number of Shares. No amount paid on a Share in advance of calls shall, while carrying interest, be treated for the purposes of this Article as paid on the Share. DividTerminations may be apportioned and paid pro rata according to the amounts paid-up on the Shares during any portion or portions of the period in respect of which the dividTermination is paid. 31 Deductions 137. The Directors may deduct from any dividTermination, distribution or other monies payable to a Member by the Company on or in respect of any Shares all sums of money (if any) presently payable by him to the Company on account of calls or otherwise in respect of Shares of the Company. Joint Holders 138. If several persons are registered as joint holders of any Share, any of them may give effectual receipts for any dividTermination or other money payable on or in respect of the Share. Payment method 139. Any dividTermination may be paid by cheque or warrant sent through the post to the address of the Member or person entitled thereto in the Register of Members or, in the case of joint holders addressed to the holder whose name stands first in the Register of Members in respect of the Shares at his registered address as appearing on the Register of Members or to such person and such address as the Member or person entitled or such joint holders as the case may be may direct in writing. Every such cheque or warrant shall, unless the holder or joint holders may in writing direct, be made payable to the order of the person to whom it is sent or to the order of the holder or, in the case of joint holders, to the order of the holder whose name stands first in the Register of Members in respect of such Shares, and shall be sent at his or their risk and payment of the cheque or warrant by the bank on which it is drawn shall constitute a good discharge to the Company. Any one of two or more joint holders may give effectual receipts for any dividTerminations, distributions or other monies payable or property distributable in respect of the Shares held by such joint holders. Satisfaction by distribution of specific assets 140. The Directors may declare that any dividTermination or distribution is paid wholly or partly by the distribution of specific assets and, in particular, of paid up shares, debentures or debenture stock of any other company or in any one or more of such ways, and where any difficulty arises in regard to such dividTermination or distribution, the Directors may settle the same as they think expedient, and in particular may issue fractional Shares or ignore fractions altogether and may fix the value for dividTermination or distribution of such specific assets or any part thereof and may determine that cash payments shall be made to any Members upon the basis of the value so fixed in order to secure equality of distribution, and may vest any such specific assets in trustees as may seem expedient to the Directors. 32 No interest 141. No dividTermination or other distribution or other monies payable by the Company on or in respect of any Share shall bear interest against the Company. Unclaimed dividTerminations 142. All unclaimed dividTerminations or distributions may be invested or otherwise made use of by the Directors for the benefit of the Company until claimed. Any dividTermination or distribution unclaimed by a Member six years after the dividTermination or distribution payment date shall be forfeited and revert to the Company. RESERVES 143. The Directors may, before declaring any dividTermination or distribution, set aside such sums as they think proper as a reserve or reserves which shall, at the discretion of the Directors, be applicable for meeting contingencies, or for equalising dividTerminations, or for any other purpose of the Company, and pTerminationing such application may, in their discretion, be employed in the business of the Company or be invested in such manner as the Directors may from time to time think fit. The Directors may also without placing the same to reserve carry forward any sums which they think it prudent not to distribute. CAPITALISATION OF PROFITS Capitalisation 144. The Directors may capitalise any sum standing to the credit of any of the Company’s reserve accounts which are available for distribution (including its Share Premium Account and capital redemption reserve fund, subject to the Law) or any sum standing to the credit of the profit and loss account or otherwise available for distribution and to appropriate such sums to Members in the proportions in which such sum would have been divisible amongst them had the same been a distribution of profits by way of dividTermination and to apply such sum on their behalf in paying up in full unissued Shares for allotment and distribution credited as fully paid-up to and amongst them in the proportion aforesaid. Authorisation 145. Where any difficulty arises in regard to any distribution under the last preceding Article, the Directors may settle the same as they think expedient and, in particular, may authorise any person to sell and Assignment any fractions or may resolve that the distribution should be as nearly as may be practicable in the correct proportion but not exactly so or may ignore fractions altogether, and may determine that cash payments should be made to any Members in order to adjust the rights of all parties, as may seem expedient to the Directors. The Directors may appoint any person to sign on behalf of the persons entitled to participate in the distribution any contract necessary or desirable for giving effect thereto and such appointment shall be effective and binding upon the Members. 33 SHARE PREMIUM ACCOUNT 146. The Directors shall in accordance with the Law establish a Share Premium Account and shall carry to the credit of such account from time to time a sum equal to the amount or value of the premium paid on the issue of any Share. 147. There shall be debited to any Share Premium Account on the redemption or purchase of a Share the difference between the nominal value of such Share and the redemption or purchase price provided always that at the discretion of the Directors such sum may be paid out of the profits of the Company or, if permitted by the Law, out of capital. ACCOUNTING RECORDS Books of account 148. The Directors shall cause to be kept accounting records sufficient to give a true and fair view of the state of the Company's affairs and to show and explain its transactions and otherwise in accordance with the Law. Inspection by Members 149. The accounting records shall be kept at the Registered Office or at such other place or places as the Directors think fit, and shall at all times be open to inspection by the Directors. No Member (who is not also a Director) shall have any right to inspect any accounting record or book or document of the Company except as conferred by law or authorised by the Directors or by the Members by Ordinary Resolution. Records and audit 150. From time to time the Company in general meeting may determine (or revoke, alter or amTermination any such determination) or, failing such determination, the Directors may determine (or revoke, alter or amTermination any such determination): 150.1 that the accounts of the Company be audited and the appointment of the Auditors; 150.2 that there be prepared and sent to each Member and other person entitled thereto a profit and loss account, a balance sheet, group accounts and/or reports for such period and on such terms as they may determine; and 150.3 that there be laid before the Company in general meeting a copy of every balance sheet together with a copy of the Auditor's report. 34 SERVICE OF NOTICES AND DOCUMENTS Form and delivery of notices 151. Notices or other documents or communications may be given to any Member by the Company either personally or by sTerminationing it by courier, post, fax or email to him to his registered address, or (if he has no registered address) to the address, if any, supplied by him to the Company for the giving of notices to him. Any notice shall be deemed to be effected: 151.1 if delivered personally or sent by courier, by properly addressing and prepaying a letter containing the notice; and to have been effected, in the case of a notice of a meeting, when delivered; 151.2 if sent by post, by properly addressing, prepaying, and posting a letter containing the notice (by airmail if available) and to have been effected, in the case of a notice of a meeting, at the Termination of three days after it was posted; and 151.3 if sent by fax or email by properly addressing and sTerminationing such notice through the appropriate transmitting medium and to have been effected on the day the same is sent. 152. A notice may be given by the Company to the joint holders of a Share by giving the notice to the joint holder named first in the Register of Members in respect of the Share. 153. A notice may be given by the Company to the person entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a Member by sTerminationing it through the post in a prepaid letter addressed to them by name, or by the title of representatives of the deceased, or trustee of the bankrupt, or by any like description, at the address, if any, supplied for the purpose by the persons claiming to be so entitled, or (until such an address has been so supplied) by giving the notice in any manner in which the same might have been given if the death or bankruptcy had not occurred. 154. Notice of every general meeting shall be given in any manner hereinbefore authorised to: 154.1 every Member entitled to vote except those Members entitled to vote who (having no registered address) have not supplied to the Company an address for the giving of notices to them; and 154.2 every person entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a Member, who, but for his death or bankruptcy would be entitled to receive notice of the meeting. 155. No other persons shall be entitled to receive notices of general meeting. 35 WINDING UP Method of winding up 156. Subject to the rights attaching to any Shares, if the Company shall be wound up, the liquidator may, with the sanction of a Special Resolution and any other sanction required by the Law or these Articles, divide amongst the Members in kind the whole or any part of the assets of the Company (whether they shall consist of property of the same kind or not) and may for such purpose set such value as he deems fair upon any property to be divided as aforesaid and may determine how such division shall be carried out as between the Members or different classes of Members. The liquidator may, with the like sanction, vest the whole or any part of such assets in trustees upon such trusts for the benefit of the contributories as the liquidator, with the like sanction, shall think fit, but so that no Member shall be compelled to accept any asset upon which there is any liability. Distribution of assets 157. If the Company shall be wound up and the assets available for distribution amongst the Members as such shall be insufficient to repay the whole of the paid up capital, such assets shall be distributed so that, as nearly as may be, the losses shall be borne by the Members in proportion to the capital paid up, or which ought to have been paid up, at the commencement of the winding up, on the Shares held by them respectively. And if in a winding up the assets available for distribution amongst the Members shall be more than sufficient to repay the whole of the capital paid up at the commencement of the winding up, the excess shall be distributed amongst the Members in proportion to the capital paid up at the commencement of the winding up on the Shares held by them respectively. This Article is to be without prejudice to the rights of the holders of Shares issued upon special terms and conditions. Indemnification Indemnification and limitation of liability 158. Every Indemnified Person shall, in the absence of wilful neglect or default, be indemnified and held harmless out of the assets of the Company against all liabilities, loss, damage, cost or expense (including but not limited to liabilities under contract, tort and statute or any applicable foreign law or regulation and all reasonable legal and other costs and expenses on a full Indemnification basis properly payable) incurred or suffered by him by or by reason of any act done, conceived in or omitted in the conduct of the Company’s business or in the discharge of his duties and the Indemnification contained in this Article shall extTermination to any Indemnified Person acting in any office or trust in the reasonable belief that he has been appointed or elected to such office or trust notwithstanding any defect in such appointment or election. 36 159. No Indemnified Person shall be liable to the Company for acts, defaults or omissions of any other Indemnified Person. Indemnification and reimbursement 160. Every Indemnified Person shall be indemnified out of the funds of the Company against all liabilities incurred by him by or by reason of any act done, conceived in or omitted in the conduct of the Company’s business or in the discharge of his duties in defTerminationing any proceedings, whether civil or criminal, in which judgment is given in his favour, or in which he is acquitted, or in connection with any application in which relief from liability is granted to him by the court. 161. To the extent that any Indemnified Person is entitled to claim an Indemnification pursuant to these Articles in respect of amounts paid or discharged by him, the relative Indemnification shall take effect as an obligation of the Company to reimburse the person making such payment or effecting such discharge. Wilful neglect or default 162. Each Member and the Company agree to waive any claim or right of action he or it may at any time have, whether individually or by or in the right of the Company, against any Indemnified Person on account of any act or omission of such Indemnified Person in the performance of his duties for the Company; provided however, that such waiver shall not apply to any claims or rights of action arising out of the wilful neglect or default of such Indemnified Person or to recover any gain, personal profit or advantage to which such Indemnified Person is not legally entitled. Advance of legal fees 163. Expenses incurred in defTerminationing any civil or criminal action or proceeding for which indemnification is required pursuant to these Articles shall be paid by the Company in advance of the final disposition of such action or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnified Person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that the Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified pursuant to these Articles. Each Member of the Company shall be deemed to have acknowledged and agreed that the advances of funds may be made by the Company as aforesaid, and when made by the Company under this Article are made to meet expTerminationitures incurred for the purpose of enabling such Indemnified Person to properly perform his or her duties to the Company. 37 CONTINUATION 164. The Company shall have the power, subject to the provisions of the Law and with the approval of a Special Resolution, to continue as a body incorporated under the laws of any jurisdiction outside of the Cayman Islands and to be de-registered in the Cayman Islands. AMTerminationMENT OF MEMORANDUM AND ARTICLES Subject to the provisions of the Law, the Company may from time to time by Special Resolution alter or amTermination the Memorandum or these Articles in whole or in part provided that no such amTerminationment shall affect the special rights attaching to any class of Shares without the consent or sanction provided for in these Articles. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Memorandum or in these Articles or in Law, for so long as HLNG is a Member, the Company shall not alter or amTermination the Memorandum or these Articles in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of HLNG 38 SCHEDULE A INSURANCE POLICIES Hull & Material Adverse Effecthinery insurance: All insurances carried, or to be carried, by the owner of the Vessel are placed as part of Höegh LNG’s fleet placements in the international insurance markets.

ISSUE OF SHARES Power to issue Shares 5. The Directors may (subject to the provisions of these Articles and the Law), without prejudice to any rights attached to any existing Shares, offer, allot, grant options over or otherwise dispose of the Shares with or without preferred, deferred, qualified or other special rights or restrictions, whether in regard to dividTerminations or other forms of distribution, voting, return of capital or otherwise, and to such persons and on such terms and conditions and for such consideration, and at such times as they think fit, provided no Share shall be issued at a discount (except in accordance with the provisions of the Law).

The Directors shall establish and maintain (or cause to be established and maintained) the Register of Members at the Registered Office or at such other place determined by the Directors in the manner prescribed by the Law. 5 RECORD DATE Power of Directors to fix record date 10. The Directors may fix in advance a date as the record date to determine the Members entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of the Members and, for the purpose of determining the Members entitled to receive payment of any dividTermination, the Directors may, at or within 90 days prior to the date of the declaration of such dividTermination, fix a subsequent date as the record date for such determination. No fixed record date 11. If no such record date is fixed, the record date shall be the date on which notice of the meeting is sent or the date on which the resolution of the Directors declaring such dividTermination is adopted, as the case may be. A determination of Members entitled to vote at any meeting of Members in accordance with this Article, shall apply to any adjournment thereof. SHARE CERTIFICATES Issue of Share Certificates 12. Every Member shall be entitled, without payment, to a certificate of the Company specifying the Share or Shares held by him and the amount paid up thereon. 13. Notwithstanding the provisions of these Articles, the Directors may resolve not to issue share certificates to Members of the Company. Certificates for jointly-held Shares 14. The Company shall not be bound to issue more than one certificate for Shares held jointly by more than one person, and delivery of a certificate to one joint holder shall be sufficient delivery to all. Replacement Share Certificates 15. If a share certificate is defaced, lost or destroyed, it may be replaced on payment of such fee (if any) and on such terms (if any) as to evidence and Indemnification, and on the payment of expenses of the Company in investigating such evidence and preparing such Indemnification as the Directors shall think fit and, in case of defacement, on delivery of the old certificate to the Company for cancellation. 6 Assignment OF SHARES Instrument of Assignment 16. The instrument of Assignment of any Share shall be executed by or on behalf of the Assignmentor (and, if the Directors so determine, the Assignmentee). The Assignmentor shall be deemed to remain the holder of the Share until the name of the Assignmentee is entered in the Register of Members in respect of such Share. All instruments of Assignment, once registered, may be retained by the Company. 17. Subject to any applicable restrictions contained in these Articles, Shares shall be Assignmentred in any usual or common form approved by the Directors. Refusal to register Assignments 18. The Directors may, in their absolute discretion and without assigning any reason therefore, decline to register any Assignment of any Share. The Directors may require reasonable evidence to show the right of the Assignmentor to make the Assignment. 19. If the Directors decline to register a Assignment of Shares they shall sTermination notice of the refusal to the Assignmentee within one month after the date on which the Assignment was lodged with the Company. 20. The Directors may also suspTermination the registration of the Assignments at such times and for such periods as the Directors may from time to time determine. TRANSMISSION OF SHARES Transmission of Shares 21. If a Member dies, the survivor or survivors (where he was a joint holder), and the legal personal representative (where he was sole holder), shall be the only person recognised by the Company as having any title to the Share. The estate of a deceased Member is not thereby released from any liability in respect of any Share held by him, whether solely or jointly. For the purpose of this Article, legal personal representative means the person to whom probate or letters of administration has or have been granted in the Cayman Islands or, if there is no such person, such other person as the Directors may in their absolute discretion determine to be the person recognised by the Company for the purpose of this Article. Election by persons entitled on transmission 22. Any person becoming entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a Member or otherwise by operation of Governing Law may elect, upon such evidence being produced as may be required by the Directors as to his entitlement, either be registered himself as a Member in respect of the Share or, instead of being registered himself, to make such Assignment of the Share as the deceased or bankrupt Member could have made. 7 Manner of election 23. If the person so becoming entitled elects to be registered himself, he shall deliver or sTermination to the Company a notice in writing signed by him stating that he so elects. If he shall elect to Assignment the Shares, he shall signify his election by signing an instrument of Assignment of such Shares in favour of his Assignmentee. All the limitations, restrictions and provisions of these Articles relating to the right to Assignment and the registration of Assignments of Shares shall be applicable to any such notice or instrument of Assignment as aforesaid as if the death of the Member or other event giving rise to the transmission had not occurred and the notice or instrument of Assignment was an instrument of Assignment signed by such Member. Rights of persons entitled on transmission 24. A person becoming entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of the Member (or otherwise by operation of Governing Law), upon such evidence being produced as may be required by the Directors as to his entitlement, shall be entitled to the same dividTerminations and other monies payable in respect of the Share as he would be entitled if he were the holder of such Share. However, he shall not be entitled, until he becomes registered as the holder of such Share, to receive notices of or to attTermination or vote at general meetings of the Company or (except as aforesaid) to exercise any other rights or privileges of a Member. The Directors may at any time give notice requiring such person to elect either to be registered himself or to Assignment the Share and, if the notice is not complied with within sixty days, the Directors may thereafter withhold payment of all dividTerminations and other monies payable in respect of the Shares until the requirements of the notice have been complied with. REDEMPTION AND PURCHASE OF SHARES 25. Subject to the provisions of the Law and the Memorandum, the Company may: 25.1 purchase its own Shares (including any redeemable Shares) in such manner and on such terms as the Directors may agree with the relevant Member unless following such purchase there would no longer be any issued Shares and may make payment for such purchase or for any redemption of Shares in any manner authorised by the Law, including out of capital; and 25.2 reduce its share capital and any capital redemption reserve fund in any manner whatsoever. 8 VARIATION OF SHARE RIGHTS Variation of class rights 26. If at any time the share capital is divided into different classes of Shares, all or any of the special rights attached to any class of Shares (unless otherwise provided by the terms of issue of the Shares of that class) may be varied or abrogated with the consent in writing of the holders of not less than two thirds of the issued Shares of that class or with the sanction of a resolution passed by the holders of not less than two thirds of the issued Shares of that class as may be present in person or by proxy at a separate general meeting of the holders of the Shares of that class. To any such separate general meeting, all of the provisions of these Articles relating to general meetings shall mutatis mutandis apply, but so that the necessary quorum shall be any one or more persons holding or representing by proxy not less than one third of the issued Shares of the class and that any holder of Shares of the relevant class present in person or by proxy may demand a poll. Treatment of classes 27. For the purpose of a separate class meeting, the Directors may treat two or more of all classes of Shares as forming one class if they consider that such class of Shares would be affected in the same way by the proposals under consideration. Effect of Share issue on class rights 28. The rights conferred upon the holders of any Shares shall not, unless otherwise expressly provided in the rights attaching to such Shares, be deemed to be altered by the creation or issue of further Shares ranking pari passu therewith. NON-RECOGNITION OF TRUSTS 29. Except as required by the Law or these Articles, or under an order of a court of competent jurisdiction, the Company shall not be bound by or compelled to recognise in any way, even when notice thereof is given to it, any equitable, contingent, future or partial interest in any Share, or any other rights in respect of any Share other than an absolute right to the entirety thereof in the registered holder. 9 LIEN Lien generally 30. The Company shall have a first and paramount lien on every Share (not being a fully paid Share) for all moneys (whether presently payable or not) called or payable at a date fixed by or in accordance with the terms of issue of such Share in respect of that Share, and the Company shall also have a first and paramount lien on every Share (other than a fully paid up Share) standing registered in the name of a Member, whether singly or jointly with any other person for all debts and liabilities of a Member or his estate to the Company, whether the same shall have been incurred before or after notice to the Company of any interest of any person other than such Member, and whether the time for the payment or discharge of the same shall have actually arrived or not, and notwithstanding that the same are joint debts or liabilities of such Member or his estate and any other person, whether a Member or not. The Directors may at any time, either generally or in any particular case, waive any lien that has arisen or declare any Share to be wholly or in part exempt from the provisions of this Article. The Company's lien, if any, on a Share shall extTermination to all dividTerminations payable thereon. Enforcement 31. The Company may sell, in such manner as the Directors think fit, any Share on which the Company has a lien, provided a sum in respect of which the lien exists is presently payable, and is not paid within fourteen days after a notice in writing has been given to the registered holder  for the time being of the Share, demanding payment of the sum presently payable and giving notice of the intention to sell in default of such payment. Completion of sale 32. For giving effect to any such sale, the Directors may authorise any person to Assignment the Share sold to the purchaser thereof. The purchaser shall be registered as the holder of the Share comprised in any such Assignment and he shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money, nor shall his title to the Share be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings relating to the sale. Application of proceeds 33. The net proceeds of such sale shall be applied in payment or discharge of the debt or liability in respect of which the lien exists and as is presently payable, and any balance shall (subject to a like lien for debts or liabilities not presently payable as existed upon the Shares prior to the sale) be paid to the person who was the registered holder of the Share immediately before such sale. CALLS ON SHARES Calls on Shares generally 34. The Directors may from time to time make calls upon the Members in respect of any moneys unpaid on their Shares (whether in respect of the par value of the Shares or premium or otherwise and not, by the terms of issue thereof, made payable at a future date fixed by or in accordance with such terms of issue); and each Member shall (subject to the Company serving upon him at least 14 days’ notice specifying the time or times and place of payment) pay to the Company at the time or times and place so specified the amount called on his Shares. A call may be revoked or postponed by the Directors wholly or in part as the Directors may determine. A call shall be deemed to have been made at the time when the resolution of the Directors authorising the call was passed. 10 Payment 35. Payment of a call may be made by instalments on the direction of the Directors. 36. If a sum called in respect of a Share is not paid before or on the day appointed for payment thereof, the person from whom the sum is due shall pay interest on the sum from the day payment is due to the time of the actual payment at such rate as the Directors may determine, but the Directors may waive payment of such interest wholly or in part. 37. Any sum payable in respect of a Share on issue or allotment or at any fixed date, whether in respect of the par value of the Share or premium or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a call and if it is not paid all the relevant provisions as to payment of interest, forfeiture or otherwise of these Articles shall apply as if such sum had become due and payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified. 38. The Directors may issue Shares with different terms as to the amount and times of payment of calls. Liability of joint holders 39. The joint holders of a Share shall be jointly and severally liable to pay calls in respect thereof. Interest 40. The Directors may, if they think fit, receive from any Member willing to advance the same, all or any part of the moneys uncalled and unpaid upon any Shares held by him; and may (until the amount would otherwise become payable) pay interest at such rate (not exceeding six per cent without the sanction of the Company in general meeting) as may be agreed upon between the Member paying the sum in advance and the Directors. FORFEITURE OF SHARES Notice 41. If a Member fails to pay any call or instalment of a call by the date it becomes due and payable, the Directors may, at any time thereafter while such call or instalment remains unpaid, give notice to the Member requiring payment of the unpaid portion of the call or instalment, together with any accrued interest and expenses incurred by the Company by reason of such non-payment. 11 42. The notice shall specify where and by what date (not being less than the Termination of 14 days’ from the date of the notice) payment is to be made and shall state that if it is not complied with the Shares in respect of which the call was made will be liable to be forfeited. The Directors may accept the surrTerminationer of any Share liable to be forfeited hereunder and, in such case, references to these Articles to forfeiture shall include surrTerminationer. Forfeiture for non-compliance 43. If such notice is not complied with, any Share in respect of which the notice was given may thereafter, before the payment of all calls or instalments and interest due in respect thereof has been made, be forfeited by a resolution of the Directors. Such forfeiture shall include all dividTerminations declared, other distributions or other monies payable in respect of the forfeited Shares and not paid before the forfeiture. Forfeited Shares 44. A forfeited Share may be sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed of upon such terms and in such manner as the Directors shall think fit, and at any time before a sale, re-allotment or disposition, the forfeiture may be cancelled on such terms as the Directors think fit. Continued liability for forfeited Member 45. A person whose Shares have been forfeited shall cease to be a Member in respect of the forfeited Shares, but shall remain liable to pay to the Company all moneys which at the date of forfeiture were presently payable by him in respect of the Shares together with interest at such rate as the Directors may determine from the date of forfeiture until payment, but his liability shall cease if and when the Company receives payment in full of all amounts due in respect of the Shares. The Company may enforce payment without being under any obligation to make any allowance for the value of the Shares forfeited. Evidence of forfeiture 46. An affidavit in writing by a Director or Secretary of the Company that a Share has been duly forfeited on a specified date, shall be conclusive evidence of the facts stated in it as against all persons claiming to be entitled to the Share. The Company may receive the consideration, if any, given for the Share on any sale, re-allotment or disposition thereof and may authorise some person to execute a Assignment of the Share in favour of the person to whom the Share is sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed of, and he shall thereupon be registered as the holder of the Share, and shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money (if any) nor shall his title to the Share be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings in reference to the forfeiture, sale, re-allotment or disposition of the Share. 12 47. The provisions of these Articles as to forfeiture shall apply in the case of non-payment of any sum which, by the terms of issue of a Share, becomes payable at a fixed time, whether on account of the par value of the Share, or by way of premium or otherwise, as if the same had been made payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified to the Member. INCREASE OF CAPITAL 48. The Company may from time to time by Ordinary Resolution increase its share capital by such sum, to be divided into new Shares of such par value, and with such rights, priorities and privileges attached thereto as the resolution shall prescribe. 49. Subject to any directions given by the Company in a general meeting, all new Shares shall be at the disposal of the Directors in accordance with these Articles. 50. The new Shares shall be subject to the same provisions of these Articles with reference to the payment of calls, lien, forfeiture, Assignment, transmission and otherwise, as the Shares in the original share capital. ALTERATION OF CAPITAL 51. The Company may from time to time by Ordinary Resolution: 51.1 consolidate and divide all or any of its share capital into Shares of larger par value than its existing Shares; 51.2 sub divide its existing Shares, or any of them, into Shares of smaller par value than is fixed by the Memorandum, subject nevertheless to the provisions of section 13 of the Law; 51.3 cancel any Shares which, at the date of the passing of the resolution, have not been taken or agreed to be taken by any person; and 51.4 convert all or any paid up Shares into stock, and reconvert all or any stock into paid up Shares of any denomination. 52. The Company may from time to time by Special Resolution: 52.1 divide its Shares into several classes and attach to such classes any preferential, deferred, or special rights or restrictions in accordance with these Articles; 52.2 change the currency denomination of its share capital; 13 52.3 reduce its share capital and any capital redemption reserve fund in any manner whatsoever; and 52.4 merge or consolidate with any one or more constituent companies (as defined in the Law). GENERAL MEETINGS Convening a meeting 53. The Directors may, whenever they think fit, convene an extraordinary general meeting. If at any time there are not sufficient Directors capable of acting to form a quorum, any Director, or any one or more Members holding in the aggregate not less than one third of the total issued share capital of the Company entitled to vote, may convene an extraordinary general meeting in the same manner as nearly as possible as that in which meetings may be convened by the Directors. Members’ requisition 54. The Directors shall, upon the requisition in writing of one or more Members holding in the aggregate not less than one tenth of such paid up capital of the Company as at the date of the requisition carries the right of voting at general meetings, convene an extraordinary general meeting. Any such requisition shall express the object of the meeting proposed to be called, and must be signed by the requisitionists and deposited at the Registered Office, and may consist of several documents in like form, each signed by one or more requisitionists. 55. If there are no Directors as at the date of the deposit of the Members’ requisition or if the Directors do not convene a general meeting within 21 days from the date of the deposit, the requisitionists or any or any of them or any other Member or Members holding in the aggregate not less than one tenth of such paid up capital of the Company as at the date of the requisition, may convene an extraordinary general meeting. A general meeting convened by requisitionists shall be convened in the same manner as nearly as possible as that in which general meetings are to be convened by the Directors. NOTICE OF GENERAL MEETINGS Length and form of notice 56. At least five clear days’ notice shall be given of any general meeting. Every notice shall specify the place, the day and the time of meeting and, in the case of special business, the general nature of the business to be conducted at the general meeting, and shall be given in the manner provided in these Articles or in such other manner (if any) as may be prescribed by the Company, to such persons as are entitled to receive such notices from the Company. A general meeting may be convened by such shorter notice, or without notice, by a majority in number of the Members having the right to attTermination and vote at the meeting, being a majority together holding not less than ninety-five percent in nominal value of the Shares giving that right. 14 Omission or non-receipt 57. The accidental omission to give notice of a meeting to, or the non-receipt of a notice of a meeting by, any Member entitled to receive notice shall not invalidate the proceedings at any meeting. PROCEEDINGS AT GENERAL MEETINGS 58. All business shall be deemed special that is transacted at an extraordinary general meeting. Quorum 59. No business shall be transacted at any general meeting unless a quorum of Members is present at the time that the meeting proceeds to business, but the absence of a quorum shall not preclude the appointment, choice or election of a chairman, which shall not be treated as part of the business of the Meeting. Save as herein otherwise provided, one or more Members holding in the aggregate not less than one third of the total issued share capital of the Company present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall be a quorum. Adjournment for lack of quorum 60. If within five minutes (or such longer time as the chairman of the meeting may determine to wait) after the time appointed for the meeting, a quorum is not present, the meeting, if convened upon the requisition of Members, shall be dissolved. In any other case, it shall stand adjourned to the same day in the next week, at the same time and place, and if at the adjourned meeting a quorum is not present within half an hour from the time appointed for the meeting, the Members present shall be a quorum. Meeting by telephone or other facilities 61. A meeting of the Members may be held by telephone, electronic or other communication facilities (including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, by telephone or video conferencing) by which all persons participating in the meeting can communicate with each other simultaneously and instantaneously, and participation in such a general meeting shall constitute presence in person at such meeting. 62. Any Director shall be entitled to attTermination and speak at any general meeting of the Company. 15 Appointment of chairman 63. The chairman (if any) of the Board of Directors shall preside as chairman at every general meeting of the Company. If there is no such chairman, or if at any meeting he is not present within five minutes after the time appointed for holding the meeting or is unwilling to act as chairman, the Directors present shall choose one of their number to act or, if only one Director is present, he shall preside as chairman if willing to act. If no Director is present, or if each of the Directors present declines to take the chair, the Members present and entitled to vote shall elect one of their number to be chairman. Adjournment of meeting 64. The chairman may, with the consent of a meeting at which a quorum is present (and shall if so directed by the meeting) adjourn the meeting from time to time and from place to place, but no business shall be transacted at any adjourned meeting other than the business left unfinished at the meeting from which the adjournment took place. When a meeting is adjourned for ten days or more, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given as in the case of an original meeting. Save as aforesaid, it shall not be necessary to give any notice of an adjournment or of the business to be transacted at an adjourned meeting. VOTING Ordinary Resolution Save where a Special Resolution or other greater majority is required by the Law or these Articles, any question proposed for consideration at any general meeting shall be decided by an Ordinary Resolution. Voting on a show of hands 65. At any general meeting, a resolution put to the vote of the meeting shall be decided on a show of hands, unless before or on the declaration of the result of the show of hands, or on the withdrawal of any other demand for a poll. Demand for poll 66. A poll is demanded by: 66.1 the chairman of the meeting; or 66.2 at least three Members present in person or by proxy; or 66.3 any Member or Members present in person or by proxy and holding collectively not less than one tenth of the total voting rights of all the Members having the right to vote at such meeting; or 16 66.4 a Member or Members present in person or by proxy holding Shares conferring the right to vote at such meeting, being Shares on which an aggregate sum has been paid up equal to not less than one tenth of the total sum paid up on all such Shares conferring such right. 67. Unless a poll is duly demanded and the demand is not withdrawn, a declaration by the chairman that a resolution has, on a show of hands, been carried or carried unanimously, or by a particular majority, or lost and an entry to that effect in the minutes of the proceedings of the Company shall be conclusive evidence of that fact, without proof of the number or proportion of the votes recorded in favour of, or against, that resolution. The demand for a poll may be withdrawn by the person or any persons making it at any time prior to the declaration of the result of the poll. 68. If a poll is duly demanded, it shall be taken in such manner as the chairman directs, and the result of the poll shall be deemed to be the resolution of the meeting at which the poll was demanded. 69. In the case of an equality of votes at a general meeting, whether on a show of hands or on a poll, the chairman of the meeting at which the show of hands takes place or at which the poll is demanded, shall not be entitled to a second or casting vote and the resolution shall fail. 70. A poll demanded on the election of a chairman or on a question of adjournment shall be taken forthwith. A poll demanded on any other question shall be taken in such manner and either forthwith or at such time later in the meeting as the chairman of the meeting shall direct. 71. The demand for a poll shall not prevent the continuance of a meeting for the transaction of any business other than the question on which the poll has been demanded and it may be withdrawn at any time before the close of the meeting or the taking of the poll, whichever is the earlier. Voting on a poll 72. On a poll votes may be cast either personally or by proxy. 73. A person entitled to more than one vote on a poll need not use all his votes or cast all the votes he uses in the same way. 74. On a show of hands, every Member present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall have one vote. On a poll, every Member present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall have one vote for each Share of which he is the registered holder. 17 75.

A committee may meet and adjourn as it thinks proper. Questions arising at any meeting shall be determined by a majority of votes of the members present and in case of an equality of votes the chairman shall not have a second or casting vote and the motion shall be deemed to have been lost. Officers 127. The Directors may appoint a Secretary and such other officers as they may from time to time consider necessary upon such terms as to duration of office, remuneration and otherwise as they may think fit. Such Secretary or other officers need not be Directors and in the case of the other officers may be ascribed such titles as the Directors may decide and the Directors may revoke or terminate any such election or appointment. Any such revocation or termination shall be without prejudice to any claim for any damages that such officer may have against the Company or the Company may have against such officer for any breach of any contract of service between him and the Company which may be involved in such revocation or termination.

DIVIDTerminationS Payment of DividTerminations 134. The Directors may from time to time declare dividTerminations to be paid to the Members according to their rights and interests, including such interim dividTerminations as appear to the Directors to be justified by the position of the Company. The Directors may also pay any fixed cash dividTermination which is payable on any Shares of the Company half yearly or on such other dates, whenever the position of the Company, in the opinion of the Directors, justifies such payment. 135. No dividTermination shall be paid otherwise than out of profits or out of monies otherwise available for dividTermination in accordance with the Law. Calculation of DividTerminations 136. Subject to the rights of Members, if any, entitled to Shares with special rights as to dividTerminations, all dividTerminations shall be declared and paid according to the amount paid up on the Shares in respect of which the dividTermination is paid and any dividTermination on any class of Shares not fully paid shall be declared and paid according to the amounts paid on the Shares of that class, but if and so long as nothing is paid up on any of the Shares in the Company, dividTerminations may be declared and paid according to the number of Shares. No amount paid on a Share in advance of calls shall, while carrying interest, be treated for the purposes of this Article as paid on the Share. DividTerminations may be apportioned and paid pro rata according to the amounts paid-up on the Shares during any portion or portions of the period in respect of which the dividTermination is paid. 31 Deductions 137. The Directors may deduct from any dividTermination, distribution or other monies payable to a Member by the Company on or in respect of any Shares all sums of money (if any) presently payable by him to the Company on account of calls or otherwise in respect of Shares of the Company. Joint Holders 138. If several persons are registered as joint holders of any Share, any of them may give effectual receipts for any dividTermination or other money payable on or in respect of the Share. Payment method 139. Any dividTermination may be paid by cheque or warrant sent through the post to the address of the Member or person entitled thereto in the Register of Members or, in the case of joint holders addressed to the holder whose name stands first in the Register of Members in respect of the Shares at his registered address as appearing on the Register of Members or to such person and such address as the Member or person entitled or such joint holders as the case may be may direct in writing. Every such cheque or warrant shall, unless the holder or joint holders may in writing direct, be made payable to the order of the person to whom it is sent or to the order of the holder or, in the case of joint holders, to the order of the holder whose name stands first in the Register of Members in respect of such Shares, and shall be sent at his or their risk and payment of the cheque or warrant by the bank on which it is drawn shall constitute a good discharge to the Company. Any one of two or more joint holders may give effectual receipts for any dividTerminations, distributions or other monies payable or property distributable in respect of the Shares held by such joint holders. Satisfaction by distribution of specific assets 140. The Directors may declare that any dividTermination or distribution is paid wholly or partly by the distribution of specific assets and, in particular, of paid up shares, debentures or debenture stock of any other company or in any one or more of such ways, and where any difficulty arises in regard to such dividTermination or distribution, the Directors may settle the same as they think expedient, and in particular may issue fractional Shares or ignore fractions altogether and may fix the value for dividTermination or distribution of such specific assets or any part thereof and may determine that cash payments shall be made to any Members upon the basis of the value so fixed in order to secure equality of distribution, and may vest any such specific assets in trustees as may seem expedient to the Directors. 32 No interest 141. No dividTermination or other distribution or other monies payable by the Company on or in respect of any Share shall bear interest against the Company. Unclaimed dividTerminations 142. All unclaimed dividTerminations or distributions may be invested or otherwise made use of by the Directors for the benefit of the Company until claimed. Any dividTermination or distribution unclaimed by a Member six years after the dividTermination or distribution payment date shall be forfeited and revert to the Company. RESERVES 143. The Directors may, before declaring any dividTermination or distribution, set aside such sums as they think proper as a reserve or reserves which shall, at the discretion of the Directors, be applicable for meeting contingencies, or for equalising dividTerminations, or for any other purpose of the Company, and pTerminationing such application may, in their discretion, be employed in the business of the Company or be invested in such manner as the Directors may from time to time think fit. The Directors may also without placing the same to reserve carry forward any sums which they think it prudent not to distribute. CAPITALISATION OF PROFITS Capitalisation 144. The Directors may capitalise any sum standing to the credit of any of the Company’s reserve accounts which are available for distribution (including its Share Premium Account and capital redemption reserve fund, subject to the Law) or any sum standing to the credit of the profit and loss account or otherwise available for distribution and to appropriate such sums to Members in the proportions in which such sum would have been divisible amongst them had the same been a distribution of profits by way of dividTermination and to apply such sum on their behalf in paying up in full unissued Shares for allotment and distribution credited as fully paid-up to and amongst them in the proportion aforesaid. Authorisation 145. Where any difficulty arises in regard to any distribution under the last preceding Article, the Directors may settle the same as they think expedient and, in particular, may authorise any person to sell and Assignment any fractions or may resolve that the distribution should be as nearly as may be practicable in the correct proportion but not exactly so or may ignore fractions altogether, and may determine that cash payments should be made to any Members in order to adjust the rights of all parties, as may seem expedient to the Directors. The Directors may appoint any person to sign on behalf of the persons entitled to participate in the distribution any contract necessary or desirable for giving effect thereto and such appointment shall be effective and binding upon the Members. 33 SHARE PREMIUM ACCOUNT 146. The Directors shall in accordance with the Law establish a Share Premium Account and shall carry to the credit of such account from time to time a sum equal to the amount or value of the premium paid on the issue of any Share. 147. There shall be debited to any Share Premium Account on the redemption or purchase of a Share the difference between the nominal value of such Share and the redemption or purchase price provided always that at the discretion of the Directors such sum may be paid out of the profits of the Company or, if permitted by the Law, out of capital. ACCOUNTING RECORDS Books of account 148. The Directors shall cause to be kept accounting records sufficient to give a true and fair view of the state of the Company's affairs and to show and explain its transactions and otherwise in accordance with the Law. Inspection by Members 149. The accounting records shall be kept at the Registered Office or at such other place or places as the Directors think fit, and shall at all times be open to inspection by the Directors.

This Article is to be without prejudice to the rights of the holders of Shares issued upon special terms and conditions. Indemnification Indemnification and limitation of liability 158.

To the extent that any Indemnified Person is entitled to claim an Indemnification pursuant to these Articles in respect of amounts paid or discharged by him, the relative Indemnification shall take effect as an obligation of the Company to reimburse the person making such payment or effecting such discharge.

Advance of legal fees 163. Expenses incurred in defTerminationing any civil or criminal action or proceeding for which indemnification is required pursuant to these Articles shall be paid by the Company in advance of the final disposition of such action or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnified Person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that the Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified pursuant to these Articles. Each Member of the Company shall be deemed to have acknowledged and agreed that the advances of funds may be made by the Company as aforesaid, and when made by the Company under this Article are made to meet expTerminationitures incurred for the purpose of enabling such Indemnified Person to properly perform his or her duties to the Company. 37 CONTINUATION 164.

TRANSMISSION OF SHARES Transmission of Shares 21. If a Member dies, the survivor or survivors (where he was a joint holder), and the legal personal representative (where he was sole holder), shall be the only person recognised by the Company as having any title to the Share. The estate of a deceased Member is not thereby released from any liability in respect of any Share held by him, whether solely or jointly. For the purpose of this Article, legal personal representative means the person to whom probate or letters of administration has or have been granted in the Cayman Islands or, if there is no such person, such other person as the Directors may in their absolute discretion determine to be the person recognised by the Company for the purpose of this Article. Election by persons entitled on transmission 22. Any person becoming entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a Member or otherwise by operation of Governing Law may elect, upon such evidence being produced as may be required by the Directors as to his entitlement, either be registered himself as a Member in respect of the Share or, instead of being registered himself, to make such Assignment of the Share as the deceased or bankrupt Member could have made. 7 Manner of election 23. If the person so becoming entitled elects to be registered himself, he shall deliver or sTermination to the Company a notice in writing signed by him stating that he so elects. If he shall elect to Assignment the Shares, he shall signify his election by signing an instrument of Assignment of such Shares in favour of his Assignmentee. All the limitations, restrictions and provisions of these Articles relating to the right to Assignment and the registration of Assignments of Shares shall be applicable to any such notice or instrument of Assignment as aforesaid as if the death of the Member or other event giving rise to the transmission had not occurred and the notice or instrument of Assignment was an instrument of Assignment signed by such Member. Rights of persons entitled on transmission 24. A person becoming entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of the Member (or otherwise by operation of Governing Law), upon such evidence being produced as may be required by the Directors as to his entitlement, shall be entitled to the same dividTerminations and other monies payable in respect of the Share as he would be entitled if he were the holder of such Share. However, he shall not be entitled, until he becomes registered as the holder of such Share, to receive notices of or to attTermination or vote at general meetings of the Company or (except as aforesaid) to exercise any other rights or privileges of a Member. The Directors may at any time give notice requiring such person to elect either to be registered himself or to Assignment the Share and, if the notice is not complied with within sixty days, the Directors may thereafter withhold payment of all dividTerminations and other monies payable in respect of the Shares until the requirements of the notice have been complied with. REDEMPTION AND PURCHASE OF SHARES 25. Subject to the provisions of the Law and the Memorandum, the Company may: 25.1 purchase its own Shares (including any redeemable Shares) in such manner and on such terms as the Directors may agree with the relevant Member unless following such purchase there would no longer be any issued Shares and may make payment for such purchase or for any redemption of Shares in any manner authorised by the Law, including out of capital; and 25.2 reduce its share capital and any capital redemption reserve fund in any manner whatsoever. 8 VARIATION OF SHARE RIGHTS Variation of class rights 26. If at any time the share capital is divided into different classes of Shares, all or any of the special rights attached to any class of Shares (unless otherwise provided by the terms of issue of the Shares of that class) may be varied or abrogated with the consent in writing of the holders of not less than two thirds of the issued Shares of that class or with the sanction of a resolution passed by the holders of not less than two thirds of the issued Shares of that class as may be present in person or by proxy at a separate general meeting of the holders of the Shares of that class. To any such separate general meeting, all of the provisions of these Articles relating to general meetings shall mutatis mutandis apply, but so that the necessary quorum shall be any one or more persons holding or representing by proxy not less than one third of the issued Shares of the class and that any holder of Shares of the relevant class present in person or by proxy may demand a poll. Treatment of classes 27. For the purpose of a separate class meeting, the Directors may treat two or more of all classes of Shares as forming one class if they consider that such class of Shares would be affected in the same way by the proposals under consideration. Effect of Share issue on class rights 28. The rights conferred upon the holders of any Shares shall not, unless otherwise expressly provided in the rights attaching to such Shares, be deemed to be altered by the creation or issue of further Shares ranking pari passu therewith. NON-RECOGNITION OF TRUSTS 29. Except as required by the Law or these Articles, or under an order of a court of competent jurisdiction, the Company shall not be bound by or compelled to recognise in any way, even when notice thereof is given to it, any equitable, contingent, future or partial interest in any Share, or any other rights in respect of any Share other than an absolute right to the entirety thereof in the registered holder. 9 LIEN Lien generally 30. The Company shall have a first and paramount lien on every Share (not being a fully paid Share) for all moneys (whether presently payable or not) called or payable at a date fixed by or in accordance with the terms of issue of such Share in respect of that Share, and the Company shall also have a first and paramount lien on every Share (other than a fully paid up Share) standing registered in the name of a Member, whether singly or jointly with any other person for all debts and liabilities of a Member or his estate to the Company, whether the same shall have been incurred before or after notice to the Company of any interest of any person other than such Member, and whether the time for the payment or discharge of the same shall have actually arrived or not, and notwithstanding that the same are joint debts or liabilities of such Member or his estate and any other person, whether a Member or not. The Directors may at any time, either generally or in any particular case, waive any lien that has arisen or declare any Share to be wholly or in part exempt from the provisions of this Article. The Company's lien, if any, on a Share shall extTermination to all dividTerminations payable thereon. Enforcement 31. The Company may sell, in such manner as the Directors think fit, any Share on which the Company has a lien, provided a sum in respect of which the lien exists is presently payable, and is not paid within fourteen days after a notice in writing has been given to the registered holder  for the time being of the Share, demanding payment of the sum presently payable and giving notice of the intention to sell in default of such payment. Completion of sale 32. For giving effect to any such sale, the Directors may authorise any person to Assignment the Share sold to the purchaser thereof. The purchaser shall be registered as the holder of the Share comprised in any such Assignment and he shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money, nor shall his title to the Share be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings relating to the sale. Application of proceeds 33. The net proceeds of such sale shall be applied in payment or discharge of the debt or liability in respect of which the lien exists and as is presently payable, and any balance shall (subject to a like lien for debts or liabilities not presently payable as existed upon the Shares prior to the sale) be paid to the person who was the registered holder of the Share immediately before such sale. CALLS ON SHARES Calls on Shares generally 34. The Directors may from time to time make calls upon the Members in respect of any moneys unpaid on their Shares (whether in respect of the par value of the Shares or premium or otherwise and not, by the terms of issue thereof, made payable at a future date fixed by or in accordance with such terms of issue); and each Member shall (subject to the Company serving upon him at least 14 days’ notice specifying the time or times and place of payment) pay to the Company at the time or times and place so specified the amount called on his Shares. A call may be revoked or postponed by the Directors wholly or in part as the Directors may determine. A call shall be deemed to have been made at the time when the resolution of the Directors authorising the call was passed. 10 Payment 35. Payment of a call may be made by instalments on the direction of the Directors. 36. If a sum called in respect of a Share is not paid before or on the day appointed for payment thereof, the person from whom the sum is due shall pay interest on the sum from the day payment is due to the time of the actual payment at such rate as the Directors may determine, but the Directors may waive payment of such interest wholly or in part. 37. Any sum payable in respect of a Share on issue or allotment or at any fixed date, whether in respect of the par value of the Share or premium or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a call and if it is not paid all the relevant provisions as to payment of interest, forfeiture or otherwise of these Articles shall apply as if such sum had become due and payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified. 38. The Directors may issue Shares with different terms as to the amount and times of payment of calls. Liability of joint holders 39. The joint holders of a Share shall be jointly and severally liable to pay calls in respect thereof. Interest 40. The Directors may, if they think fit, receive from any Member willing to advance the same, all or any part of the moneys uncalled and unpaid upon any Shares held by him; and may (until the amount would otherwise become payable) pay interest at such rate (not exceeding six per cent without the sanction of the Company in general meeting) as may be agreed upon between the Member paying the sum in advance and the Directors. FORFEITURE OF SHARES Notice 41. If a Member fails to pay any call or instalment of a call by the date it becomes due and payable, the Directors may, at any time thereafter while such call or instalment remains unpaid, give notice to the Member requiring payment of the unpaid portion of the call or instalment, together with any accrued interest and expenses incurred by the Company by reason of such non-payment. 11 42. The notice shall specify where and by what date (not being less than the Termination of 14 days’ from the date of the notice) payment is to be made and shall state that if it is not complied with the Shares in respect of which the call was made will be liable to be forfeited. The Directors may accept the surrTerminationer of any Share liable to be forfeited hereunder and, in such case, references to these Articles to forfeiture shall include surrTerminationer. Forfeiture for non-compliance 43. If such notice is not complied with, any Share in respect of which the notice was given may thereafter, before the payment of all calls or instalments and interest due in respect thereof has been made, be forfeited by a resolution of the Directors. Such forfeiture shall include all dividTerminations declared, other distributions or other monies payable in respect of the forfeited Shares and not paid before the forfeiture. Forfeited Shares 44. A forfeited Share may be sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed of upon such terms and in such manner as the Directors shall think fit, and at any time before a sale, re-allotment or disposition, the forfeiture may be cancelled on such terms as the Directors think fit. Continued liability for forfeited Member 45. A person whose Shares have been forfeited shall cease to be a Member in respect of the forfeited Shares, but shall remain liable to pay to the Company all moneys which at the date of forfeiture were presently payable by him in respect of the Shares together with interest at such rate as the Directors may determine from the date of forfeiture until payment, but his liability shall cease if and when the Company receives payment in full of all amounts due in respect of the Shares. The Company may enforce payment without being under any obligation to make any allowance for the value of the Shares forfeited. Evidence of forfeiture 46. An affidavit in writing by a Director or Secretary of the Company that a Share has been duly forfeited on a specified date, shall be conclusive evidence of the facts stated in it as against all persons claiming to be entitled to the Share. The Company may receive the consideration, if any, given for the Share on any sale, re-allotment or disposition thereof and may authorise some person to execute a Assignment of the Share in favour of the person to whom the Share is sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed of, and he shall thereupon be registered as the holder of the Share, and shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money (if any) nor shall his title to the Share be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings in reference to the forfeiture, sale, re-allotment or disposition of the Share. 12 47. The provisions of these Articles as to forfeiture shall apply in the case of non-payment of any sum which, by the terms of issue of a Share, becomes payable at a fixed time, whether on account of the par value of the Share, or by way of premium or otherwise, as if the same had been made payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified to the Member. INCREASE OF CAPITAL 48. The Company may from time to time by Ordinary Resolution increase its share capital by such sum, to be divided into new Shares of such par value, and with such rights, priorities and privileges attached thereto as the resolution shall prescribe. 49. Subject to any directions given by the Company in a general meeting, all new Shares shall be at the disposal of the Directors in accordance with these Articles. 50. The new Shares shall be subject to the same provisions of these Articles with reference to the payment of calls, lien, forfeiture, Assignment, transmission and otherwise, as the Shares in the original share capital. ALTERATION OF CAPITAL 51. The Company may from time to time by Ordinary Resolution: 51.1 consolidate and divide all or any of its share capital into Shares of larger par value than its existing Shares; 51.2 sub divide its existing Shares, or any of them, into Shares of smaller par value than is fixed by the Memorandum, subject nevertheless to the provisions of section 13 of the Law; 51.3 cancel any Shares which, at the date of the passing of the resolution, have not been taken or agreed to be taken by any person; and 51.4 convert all or any paid up Shares into stock, and reconvert all or any stock into paid up Shares of any denomination. 52. The Company may from time to time by Special Resolution: 52.1 divide its Shares into several classes and attach to such classes any preferential, deferred, or special rights or restrictions in accordance with these Articles; 52.2 change the currency denomination of its share capital; 13 52.3 reduce its share capital and any capital redemption reserve fund in any manner whatsoever; and 52.4 merge or consolidate with any one or more constituent companies (as defined in the Law).

In any other case, it shall stand adjourned to the same day in the next week, at the same time and place, and if at the adjourned meeting a quorum is not present within half an hour from the time appointed for the meeting, the Members present shall be a quorum.

A meeting of the Members may be held by telephone, electronic or other communication facilities (including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, by telephone or video conferencing) by which all persons participating in the meeting can communicate with each other simultaneously and instantaneously, and participation in such a general meeting shall constitute presence in person at such meeting. 62. Any Director shall be entitled to attTermination and speak at any general meeting of the Company. 15 Appointment of chairman 63.

If no Director is present, or if each of the Directors present declines to take the chair, the Members present and entitled to vote shall elect one of their number to be chairman. Adjournment of meeting 64. The chairman may, with the consent of a meeting at which a quorum is present (and shall if so directed by the meeting) adjourn the meeting from time to time and from place to place, but no business shall be transacted at any adjourned meeting other than the business left unfinished at the meeting from which the adjournment took place. When a meeting is adjourned for ten days or more, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given as in the case of an original meeting. Save as aforesaid, it shall not be necessary to give any notice of an adjournment or of the business to be transacted at an adjourned meeting. VOTING Ordinary Resolution Save where a Special Resolution or other greater majority is required by the Law or these Articles, any question proposed for consideration at any general meeting shall be decided by an Ordinary Resolution.

Unless a poll is duly demanded and the demand is not withdrawn, a declaration by the chairman that a resolution has, on a show of hands, been carried or carried unanimously, or by a particular majority, or lost and an entry to that effect in the minutes of the proceedings of the Company shall be conclusive evidence of that fact, without proof of the number or proportion of the votes recorded in favour of, or against, that resolution. The demand for a poll may be withdrawn by the person or any persons making it at any time prior to the declaration of the result of the poll. 68. If a poll is duly demanded, it shall be taken in such manner as the chairman directs, and the result of the poll shall be deemed to be the resolution of the meeting at which the poll was demanded. 69. In the case of an equality of votes at a general meeting, whether on a show of hands or on a poll, the chairman of the meeting at which the show of hands takes place or at which the poll is demanded, shall not be entitled to a second or casting vote and the resolution shall fail. 70. A poll demanded on the election of a chairman or on a question of adjournment shall be taken forthwith.

Voting on a poll 72. On a poll votes may be cast either personally or by proxy. 73.

On a poll, every Member present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall have one vote for each Share of which he is the registered holder. 17 75. In the case of joint holders of a Share, the vote of the senior who tTerminationers a vote, whether in person or by proxy, shall be accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint holders; and for this purpose seniority shall be determined by the order in which the names stand in the Register of Members in respect of the joint holding. 76. A Member of unsound mind, or, in respect of whom an order has been made by any court having jurisdiction in lunacy, may vote, whether on a show of hands or on a poll, by his receiver, committee, curator bonis or other person of similar nature appointed by such court, and any such receiver, committee, curator bonis or other person may vote by proxy and may otherwise act and be treated as such Member for the purpose of the general meetings. 77. No Member, unless the Directors otherwise determine, shall be entitled to vote at any general meeting, unless all calls or other sums presently payable by him in respect of Shares in the Company have been paid. 78. No objection shall be raised as to the qualification of any voter or as to whether any votes have been properly counted except at the general meeting or adjourned general meeting at which the vote objected to is given or tTerminationered and every vote not disallowed at the meeting shall be valid.

A Director (or his alternate Director in his absence) shall be at liberty to vote in respect of any contract or transaction in which he is interested provided that the nature of the interest of the Director in any such contract or transaction shall be disclosed by him at or prior to its consideration and any vote thereon. 117. The nature of the interest of any Director or officer in any contract, dealing or transacting with or affecting the Company shall be disclosed by him at or prior to its consideration and any vote thereon and a general notice that a Director or officer is a shareholder of any specified firm or company and/or is to be regarded as interested in any transaction with such firm or company shall be sufficient disclosure hereunder and after such general notice it shall not be necessary to give special notice relating to any particular transaction. 27 DELEGATION OF DIRECTORS’ POWERS Power to delegate 118. Directors may from time to time and at any time by power of attorney or otherwise appoint any company, firm or person or fluctuating body of persons, whether nominated directly or indirectly by the Directors, to be the attorney or attorneys of the Company for such purposes and with such powers, authorities and discretions (not exceeding those vested in or exercisable by the Directors under these Articles) and for such period and subject to such conditions as they may think fit, and any such power of attorney may contain such provisions for the protection and convenience of persons dealing with any such attorney and of such attorney as the Directors may think fit and may also authorise any such attorney to delegate all or any of the powers, authorities and discretions vested in him. 119. The Directors may delegate any of the powers exercisable by them to a Managing Director , Director or any other person or persons acting individually or jointly as they may from time to time by resolution appoint upon such terms and conditions and with such restrictions as they may think fit, and may from time to time by resolution revoke, withdraw, alter or vary all or any such powers. Alternate Directors 120. Any Director may by writing appoint any other Director, or other person willing to act, to be his alternate and remove his alternate so appointed by him. Such appointment or removal shall be by notice to the Registered Office signed by the Director making or revoking the appointment or in any other manner approved by the Directors, and shall be effective on the date the notice is served and the alternate shall be notified of such appointment or revocation. Subject to the removal by the appointing Director, the alternate shall continue in office until the date on which his appointor ceases to be a Director. An alternate may also be a Director in his own right and may act as alternate to more than one Director. 121. An alternate shall be entitled to receive notice of all meetings of the Directors, attTermination, be counted in the quorum, vote and act in such appointor’s place at every such meeting at which the appointing Director is not personally present, and generally to perform all the functions of his appointor as a Director in his absence. 122. These Articles (except as regards powers to appoint an alternate and remuneration) apply equally to the alternate as though he were the Director in his own right. 123. An alternate Director shall be deemed for all purposes to be a Director and shall alone be responsible for his own acts and defaults and shall not be deemed to be the agent of the Director appointing him. The signature of an alternate to any resolution in writing of the Director or a committee there shall, unless the terms of the appointment provides to the contrary, be as effective as the signature of the Director or Directors to whom he is alternate. 28 Committees of Directors 124. The Directors may delegate any of their powers to committees consisting of such member or members of their body as they think fit; any committee so formed shall, in the exercise of the powers so delegated, conform to any regulations that may be imposed on it by the Directors. 125. A committee may elect a chairman of its meetings; if no such chairman is elected, or if at any meeting the chairman is not present within five minutes after the time appointed for holding the same, the members present may choose one of their number to be chairman of the meeting. 126. A committee may meet and adjourn as it thinks proper. Questions arising at any meeting shall be determined by a majority of votes of the members present and in case of an equality of votes the chairman shall not have a second or casting vote and the motion shall be deemed to have been lost. Officers 127. The Directors may appoint a Secretary and such other officers as they may from time to time consider necessary upon such terms as to duration of office, remuneration and otherwise as they may think fit. Such Secretary or other officers need not be Directors and in the case of the other officers may be ascribed such titles as the Directors may decide and the Directors may revoke or terminate any such election or appointment. Any such revocation or termination shall be without prejudice to any claim for any damages that such officer may have against the Company or the Company may have against such officer for any breach of any contract of service between him and the Company which may be involved in such revocation or termination. Save as provided in the Law or these Articles, the powers and duties of the officers of the Company shall be such (if any) as are determined from time to time by the Directors. DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION Remuneration 128. The remuneration to be paid to the Directors, if any, shall be determined by the Company in general meeting or, in the absence of such a determination, by the Directors. Expenses 129. Each Director shall also be entitled to be paid his reasonable travelling, hotel and other expenses properly incurred by him in connection with his attTerminationance at meetings of the Directors, committees of the Directors or general meetings of the Company, or otherwise in connection with the business of the Company, or to receive a fixed allowance in respect thereof as may be determined by the Directors, or a combination partly of one such method and partly the other. 29 Additional remuneration 130. The Directors may by resolution approve additional remuneration to any Director for services which in the opinion of the Directors go beyond the ordinary duties of a Director, and such extra remuneration shall be in addition to any remuneration provided for, by or pursuant to any other Article. SEALS AND DEEDS Use of Seal 131. The Directors may determine that the Company shall have a Seal, and if they so determine, shall provide for the safe custody of the Seal. The Seal shall only be used by the authority of the Directors and in the presence of a Director or the Secretary or such other person as the Directors may by resolution appoint for this purpose, and every instrument to which the Seal affixed shall be signed by the relevant person. Notwithstanding the above, annual returns and notices filed under the Law may be executed either as a deed or under Seal and in either case without the need for the authority of a resolution of the Directors. 30 Duplicate Seal 132. The Company may maintain in any place or places outside the Cayman Islands a facsimile of any Seal and such facsimile seal shall be affixed in the same way as if it were the Seal. Execution of deeds 133. In accordance with the Law, the Company may execute any deed or other instrument (which would otherwise be required to be executed under Seal) by the signature of such deed or instrument as a deed by a Director or by the Secretary of the Company or by such other person as the Directors may appoint or by any other person or attorney on behalf of the Company appointed by a deed or other instrument executed as a deed by a Director or the Secretary or such other person as aforesaid. DIVIDTerminationS Payment of DividTerminations 134. The Directors may from time to time declare dividTerminations to be paid to the Members according to their rights and interests, including such interim dividTerminations as appear to the Directors to be justified by the position of the Company. The Directors may also pay any fixed cash dividTermination which is payable on any Shares of the Company half yearly or on such other dates, whenever the position of the Company, in the opinion of the Directors, justifies such payment. 135. No dividTermination shall be paid otherwise than out of profits or out of monies otherwise available for dividTermination in accordance with the Law. Calculation of DividTerminations 136. Subject to the rights of Members, if any, entitled to Shares with special rights as to dividTerminations, all dividTerminations shall be declared and paid according to the amount paid up on the Shares in respect of which the dividTermination is paid and any dividTermination on any class of Shares not fully paid shall be declared and paid according to the amounts paid on the Shares of that class, but if and so long as nothing is paid up on any of the Shares in the Company, dividTerminations may be declared and paid according to the number of Shares. No amount paid on a Share in advance of calls shall, while carrying interest, be treated for the purposes of this Article as paid on the Share. DividTerminations may be apportioned and paid pro rata according to the amounts paid-up on the Shares during any portion or portions of the period in respect of which the dividTermination is paid. 31 Deductions 137. The Directors may deduct from any dividTermination, distribution or other monies payable to a Member by the Company on or in respect of any Shares all sums of money (if any) presently payable by him to the Company on account of calls or otherwise in respect of Shares of the Company. Joint Holders 138. If several persons are registered as joint holders of any Share, any of them may give effectual receipts for any dividTermination or other money payable on or in respect of the Share. Payment method 139. Any dividTermination may be paid by cheque or warrant sent through the post to the address of the Member or person entitled thereto in the Register of Members or, in the case of joint holders addressed to the holder whose name stands first in the Register of Members in respect of the Shares at his registered address as appearing on the Register of Members or to such person and such address as the Member or person entitled or such joint holders as the case may be may direct in writing. Every such cheque or warrant shall, unless the holder or joint holders may in writing direct, be made payable to the order of the person to whom it is sent or to the order of the holder or, in the case of joint holders, to the order of the holder whose name stands first in the Register of Members in respect of such Shares, and shall be sent at his or their risk and payment of the cheque or warrant by the bank on which it is drawn shall constitute a good discharge to the Company. Any one of two or more joint holders may give effectual receipts for any dividTerminations, distributions or other monies payable or property distributable in respect of the Shares held by such joint holders. Satisfaction by distribution of specific assets 140. The Directors may declare that any dividTermination or distribution is paid wholly or partly by the distribution of specific assets and, in particular, of paid up shares, debentures or debenture stock of any other company or in any one or more of such ways, and where any difficulty arises in regard to such dividTermination or distribution, the Directors may settle the same as they think expedient, and in particular may issue fractional Shares or ignore fractions altogether and may fix the value for dividTermination or distribution of such specific assets or any part thereof and may determine that cash payments shall be made to any Members upon the basis of the value so fixed in order to secure equality of distribution, and may vest any such specific assets in trustees as may seem expedient to the Directors. 32 No interest 141. No dividTermination or other distribution or other monies payable by the Company on or in respect of any Share shall bear interest against the Company. Unclaimed dividTerminations 142. All unclaimed dividTerminations or distributions may be invested or otherwise made use of by the Directors for the benefit of the Company until claimed. Any dividTermination or distribution unclaimed by a Member six years after the dividTermination or distribution payment date shall be forfeited and revert to the Company. RESERVES 143. The Directors may, before declaring any dividTermination or distribution, set aside such sums as they think proper as a reserve or reserves which shall, at the discretion of the Directors, be applicable for meeting contingencies, or for equalising dividTerminations, or for any other purpose of the Company, and pTerminationing such application may, in their discretion, be employed in the business of the Company or be invested in such manner as the Directors may from time to time think fit. The Directors may also without placing the same to reserve carry forward any sums which they think it prudent not to distribute. CAPITALISATION OF PROFITS Capitalisation 144. The Directors may capitalise any sum standing to the credit of any of the Company’s reserve accounts which are available for distribution (including its Share Premium Account and capital redemption reserve fund, subject to the Law) or any sum standing to the credit of the profit and loss account or otherwise available for distribution and to appropriate such sums to Members in the proportions in which such sum would have been divisible amongst them had the same been a distribution of profits by way of dividTermination and to apply such sum on their behalf in paying up in full unissued Shares for allotment and distribution credited as fully paid-up to and amongst them in the proportion aforesaid. Authorisation 145. Where any difficulty arises in regard to any distribution under the last preceding Article, the Directors may settle the same as they think expedient and, in particular, may authorise any person to sell and Assignment any fractions or may resolve that the distribution should be as nearly as may be practicable in the correct proportion but not exactly so or may ignore fractions altogether, and may determine that cash payments should be made to any Members in order to adjust the rights of all parties, as may seem expedient to the Directors. The Directors may appoint any person to sign on behalf of the persons entitled to participate in the distribution any contract necessary or desirable for giving effect thereto and such appointment shall be effective and binding upon the Members. 33 SHARE PREMIUM ACCOUNT 146. The Directors shall in accordance with the Law establish a Share Premium Account and shall carry to the credit of such account from time to time a sum equal to the amount or value of the premium paid on the issue of any Share. 147. There shall be debited to any Share Premium Account on the redemption or purchase of a Share the difference between the nominal value of such Share and the redemption or purchase price provided always that at the discretion of the Directors such sum may be paid out of the profits of the Company or, if permitted by the Law, out of capital. ACCOUNTING RECORDS Books of account 148. The Directors shall cause to be kept accounting records sufficient to give a true and fair view of the state of the Company's affairs and to show and explain its transactions and otherwise in accordance with the Law. Inspection by Members 149. The accounting records shall be kept at the Registered Office or at such other place or places as the Directors think fit, and shall at all times be open to inspection by the Directors. No Member (who is not also a Director) shall have any right to inspect any accounting record or book or document of the Company except as conferred by law or authorised by the Directors or by the Members by Ordinary Resolution. Records and audit 150. From time to time the Company in general meeting may determine (or revoke, alter or amTermination any such determination) or, failing such determination, the Directors may determine (or revoke, alter or amTermination any such determination): 150.1 that the accounts of the Company be audited and the appointment of the Auditors; 150.2 that there be prepared and sent to each Member and other person entitled thereto a profit and loss account, a balance sheet, group accounts and/or reports for such period and on such terms as they may determine; and 150.3 that there be laid before the Company in general meeting a copy of every balance sheet together with a copy of the Auditor's report. 34 SERVICE OF NOTICES AND DOCUMENTS Form and delivery of notices 151. Notices or other documents or communications may be given to any Member by the Company either personally or by sTerminationing it by courier, post, fax or email to him to his registered address, or (if he has no registered address) to the address, if any, supplied by him to the Company for the giving of notices to him. Any notice shall be deemed to be effected: 151.1 if delivered personally or sent by courier, by properly addressing and prepaying a letter containing the notice; and to have been effected, in the case of a notice of a meeting, when delivered; 151.2 if sent by post, by properly addressing, prepaying, and posting a letter containing the notice (by airmail if available) and to have been effected, in the case of a notice of a meeting, at the Termination of three days after it was posted; and 151.3 if sent by fax or email by properly addressing and sTerminationing such notice through the appropriate transmitting medium and to have been effected on the day the same is sent. 152. A notice may be given by the Company to the joint holders of a Share by giving the notice to the joint holder named first in the Register of Members in respect of the Share. 153. A notice may be given by the Company to the person entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a Member by sTerminationing it through the post in a prepaid letter addressed to them by name, or by the title of representatives of the deceased, or trustee of the bankrupt, or by any like description, at the address, if any, supplied for the purpose by the persons claiming to be so entitled, or (until such an address has been so supplied) by giving the notice in any manner in which the same might have been given if the death or bankruptcy had not occurred. 154. Notice of every general meeting shall be given in any manner hereinbefore authorised to: 154.1 every Member entitled to vote except those Members entitled to vote who (having no registered address) have not supplied to the Company an address for the giving of notices to them; and 154.2 every person entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a Member, who, but for his death or bankruptcy would be entitled to receive notice of the meeting. 155. No other persons shall be entitled to receive notices of general meeting. 35 WINDING UP Method of winding up 156. Subject to the rights attaching to any Shares, if the Company shall be wound up, the liquidator may, with the sanction of a Special Resolution and any other sanction required by the Law or these Articles, divide amongst the Members in kind the whole or any part of the assets of the Company (whether they shall consist of property of the same kind or not) and may for such purpose set such value as he deems fair upon any property to be divided as aforesaid and may determine how such division shall be carried out as between the Members or different classes of Members. The liquidator may, with the like sanction, vest the whole or any part of such assets in trustees upon such trusts for the benefit of the contributories as the liquidator, with the like sanction, shall think fit, but so that no Member shall be compelled to accept any asset upon which there is any liability. Distribution of assets 157. If the Company shall be wound up and the assets available for distribution amongst the Members as such shall be insufficient to repay the whole of the paid up capital, such assets shall be distributed so that, as nearly as may be, the losses shall be borne by the Members in proportion to the capital paid up, or which ought to have been paid up, at the commencement of the winding up, on the Shares held by them respectively. And if in a winding up the assets available for distribution amongst the Members shall be more than sufficient to repay the whole of the capital paid up at the commencement of the winding up, the excess shall be distributed amongst the Members in proportion to the capital paid up at the commencement of the winding up on the Shares held by them respectively. This Article is to be without prejudice to the rights of the holders of Shares issued upon special terms and conditions. Indemnification Indemnification and limitation of liability 158. Every Indemnified Person shall, in the absence of wilful neglect or default, be indemnified and held harmless out of the assets of the Company against all liabilities, loss, damage, cost or expense (including but not limited to liabilities under contract, tort and statute or any applicable foreign law or regulation and all reasonable legal and other costs and expenses on a full Indemnification basis properly payable) incurred or suffered by him by or by reason of any act done, conceived in or omitted in the conduct of the Company’s business or in the discharge of his duties and the Indemnification contained in this Article shall extTermination to any Indemnified Person acting in any office or trust in the reasonable belief that he has been appointed or elected to such office or trust notwithstanding any defect in such appointment or election. 36 159. No Indemnified Person shall be liable to the Company for acts, defaults or omissions of any other Indemnified Person. Indemnification and reimbursement 160. Every Indemnified Person shall be indemnified out of the funds of the Company against all liabilities incurred by him by or by reason of any act done, conceived in or omitted in the conduct of the Company’s business or in the discharge of his duties in defTerminationing any proceedings, whether civil or criminal, in which judgment is given in his favour, or in which he is acquitted, or in connection with any application in which relief from liability is granted to him by the court. 161. To the extent that any Indemnified Person is entitled to claim an Indemnification pursuant to these Articles in respect of amounts paid or discharged by him, the relative Indemnification shall take effect as an obligation of the Company to reimburse the person making such payment or effecting such discharge. Wilful neglect or default 162. Each Member and the Company agree to waive any claim or right of action he or it may at any time have, whether individually or by or in the right of the Company, against any Indemnified Person on account of any act or omission of such Indemnified Person in the performance of his duties for the Company; provided however, that such waiver shall not apply to any claims or rights of action arising out of the wilful neglect or default of such Indemnified Person or to recover any gain, personal profit or advantage to which such Indemnified Person is not legally entitled. Advance of legal fees 163. Expenses incurred in defTerminationing any civil or criminal action or proceeding for which indemnification is required pursuant to these Articles shall be paid by the Company in advance of the final disposition of such action or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnified Person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that the Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified pursuant to these Articles. Each Member of the Company shall be deemed to have acknowledged and agreed that the advances of funds may be made by the Company as aforesaid, and when made by the Company under this Article are made to meet expTerminationitures incurred for the purpose of enabling such Indemnified Person to properly perform his or her duties to the Company. 37 CONTINUATION 164. The Company shall have the power, subject to the provisions of the Law and with the approval of a Special Resolution, to continue as a body incorporated under the laws of any jurisdiction outside of the Cayman Islands and to be de-registered in the Cayman Islands. AMTerminationMENT OF MEMORANDUM AND ARTICLES Subject to the provisions of the Law, the Company may from time to time by Special Resolution alter or amTermination the Memorandum or these Articles in whole or in part provided that no such amTerminationment shall affect the special rights attaching to any class of Shares without the consent or sanction provided for in these Articles. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Memorandum or in these Articles or in Law, for so long as HLNG is a Member, the Company shall not alter or amTermination the Memorandum or these Articles in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of HLNG 38 SCHEDULE A INSURANCE POLICIES Hull & Material Adverse Effecthinery insurance: All insurances carried, or to be carried, by the owner of the Vessel are placed as part of Höegh LNG’s fleet placements in the international insurance markets.

The Directors may fix in advance a date as the record date to determine the Members entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of the Members and, for the purpose of determining the Members entitled to receive payment of any dividTermination, the Directors may, at or within 90 days prior to the date of the declaration of such dividTermination, fix a subsequent date as the record date for such determination. No fixed record date 11. If no such record date is fixed, the record date shall be the date on which notice of the meeting is sent or the date on which the resolution of the Directors declaring such dividTermination is adopted, as the case may be. A determination of Members entitled to vote at any meeting of Members in accordance with this Article, shall apply to any adjournment thereof. SHARE CERTIFICATES Issue of Share Certificates 12.

The instrument of Assignment of any Share shall be executed by or on behalf of the Assignmentor (and, if the Directors so determine, the Assignmentee). The Assignmentor shall be deemed to remain the holder of the Share until the name of the Assignmentee is entered in the Register of Members in respect of such Share. All instruments of Assignment, once registered, may be retained by the Company. 17. Subject to any applicable restrictions contained in these Articles, Shares shall be Assignmentred in any usual or common form approved by the Directors. Refusal to register Assignments 18. The Directors may, in their absolute discretion and without assigning any reason therefore, decline to register any Assignment of any Share. The Directors may require reasonable evidence to show the right of the Assignmentor to make the Assignment. 19. If the Directors decline to register a Assignment of Shares they shall sTermination notice of the refusal to the Assignmentee within one month after the date on which the Assignment was lodged with the Company. 20. The Directors may also suspTermination the registration of the Assignments at such times and for such periods as the Directors may from time to time determine. TRANSMISSION OF SHARES Transmission of Shares 21. If a Member dies, the survivor or survivors (where he was a joint holder), and the legal personal representative (where he was sole holder), shall be the only person recognised by the Company as having any title to the Share. The estate of a deceased Member is not thereby released from any liability in respect of any Share held by him, whether solely or jointly. For the purpose of this Article, legal personal representative means the person to whom probate or letters of administration has or have been granted in the Cayman Islands or, if there is no such person, such other person as the Directors may in their absolute discretion determine to be the person recognised by the Company for the purpose of this Article. Election by persons entitled on transmission 22. Any person becoming entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a Member or otherwise by operation of Governing Law may elect, upon such evidence being produced as may be required by the Directors as to his entitlement, either be registered himself as a Member in respect of the Share or, instead of being registered himself, to make such Assignment of the Share as the deceased or bankrupt Member could have made. 7 Manner of election 23. If the person so becoming entitled elects to be registered himself, he shall deliver or sTermination to the Company a notice in writing signed by him stating that he so elects. If he shall elect to Assignment the Shares, he shall signify his election by signing an instrument of Assignment of such Shares in favour of his Assignmentee. All the limitations, restrictions and provisions of these Articles relating to the right to Assignment and the registration of Assignments of Shares shall be applicable to any such notice or instrument of Assignment as aforesaid as if the death of the Member or other event giving rise to the transmission had not occurred and the notice or instrument of Assignment was an instrument of Assignment signed by such Member. Rights of persons entitled on transmission 24. A person becoming entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of the Member (or otherwise by operation of Governing Law), upon such evidence being produced as may be required by the Directors as to his entitlement, shall be entitled to the same dividTerminations and other monies payable in respect of the Share as he would be entitled if he were the holder of such Share. However, he shall not be entitled, until he becomes registered as the holder of such Share, to receive notices of or to attTermination or vote at general meetings of the Company or (except as aforesaid) to exercise any other rights or privileges of a Member. The Directors may at any time give notice requiring such person to elect either to be registered himself or to Assignment the Share and, if the notice is not complied with within sixty days, the Directors may thereafter withhold payment of all dividTerminations and other monies payable in respect of the Shares until the requirements of the notice have been complied with. REDEMPTION AND PURCHASE OF SHARES 25. Subject to the provisions of the Law and the Memorandum, the Company may: 25.1 purchase its own Shares (including any redeemable Shares) in such manner and on such terms as the Directors may agree with the relevant Member unless following such purchase there would no longer be any issued Shares and may make payment for such purchase or for any redemption of Shares in any manner authorised by the Law, including out of capital; and 25.2 reduce its share capital and any capital redemption reserve fund in any manner whatsoever. 8 VARIATION OF SHARE RIGHTS Variation of class rights 26. If at any time the share capital is divided into different classes of Shares, all or any of the special rights attached to any class of Shares (unless otherwise provided by the terms of issue of the Shares of that class) may be varied or abrogated with the consent in writing of the holders of not less than two thirds of the issued Shares of that class or with the sanction of a resolution passed by the holders of not less than two thirds of the issued Shares of that class as may be present in person or by proxy at a separate general meeting of the holders of the Shares of that class. To any such separate general meeting, all of the provisions of these Articles relating to general meetings shall mutatis mutandis apply, but so that the necessary quorum shall be any one or more persons holding or representing by proxy not less than one third of the issued Shares of the class and that any holder of Shares of the relevant class present in person or by proxy may demand a poll. Treatment of classes 27. For the purpose of a separate class meeting, the Directors may treat two or more of all classes of Shares as forming one class if they consider that such class of Shares would be affected in the same way by the proposals under consideration. Effect of Share issue on class rights 28. The rights conferred upon the holders of any Shares shall not, unless otherwise expressly provided in the rights attaching to such Shares, be deemed to be altered by the creation or issue of further Shares ranking pari passu therewith. NON-RECOGNITION OF TRUSTS 29. Except as required by the Law or these Articles, or under an order of a court of competent jurisdiction, the Company shall not be bound by or compelled to recognise in any way, even when notice thereof is given to it, any equitable, contingent, future or partial interest in any Share, or any other rights in respect of any Share other than an absolute right to the entirety thereof in the registered holder. 9 LIEN Lien generally 30. The Company shall have a first and paramount lien on every Share (not being a fully paid Share) for all moneys (whether presently payable or not) called or payable at a date fixed by or in accordance with the terms of issue of such Share in respect of that Share, and the Company shall also have a first and paramount lien on every Share (other than a fully paid up Share) standing registered in the name of a Member, whether singly or jointly with any other person for all debts and liabilities of a Member or his estate to the Company, whether the same shall have been incurred before or after notice to the Company of any interest of any person other than such Member, and whether the time for the payment or discharge of the same shall have actually arrived or not, and notwithstanding that the same are joint debts or liabilities of such Member or his estate and any other person, whether a Member or not. The Directors may at any time, either generally or in any particular case, waive any lien that has arisen or declare any Share to be wholly or in part exempt from the provisions of this Article. The Company's lien, if any, on a Share shall extTermination to all dividTerminations payable thereon. Enforcement 31. The Company may sell, in such manner as the Directors think fit, any Share on which the Company has a lien, provided a sum in respect of which the lien exists is presently payable, and is not paid within fourteen days after a notice in writing has been given to the registered holder  for the time being of the Share, demanding payment of the sum presently payable and giving notice of the intention to sell in default of such payment. Completion of sale 32. For giving effect to any such sale, the Directors may authorise any person to Assignment the Share sold to the purchaser thereof. The purchaser shall be registered as the holder of the Share comprised in any such Assignment and he shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money, nor shall his title to the Share be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings relating to the sale. Application of proceeds 33. The net proceeds of such sale shall be applied in payment or discharge of the debt or liability in respect of which the lien exists and as is presently payable, and any balance shall (subject to a like lien for debts or liabilities not presently payable as existed upon the Shares prior to the sale) be paid to the person who was the registered holder of the Share immediately before such sale. CALLS ON SHARES Calls on Shares generally 34. The Directors may from time to time make calls upon the Members in respect of any moneys unpaid on their Shares (whether in respect of the par value of the Shares or premium or otherwise and not, by the terms of issue thereof, made payable at a future date fixed by or in accordance with such terms of issue); and each Member shall (subject to the Company serving upon him at least 14 days’ notice specifying the time or times and place of payment) pay to the Company at the time or times and place so specified the amount called on his Shares. A call may be revoked or postponed by the Directors wholly or in part as the Directors may determine. A call shall be deemed to have been made at the time when the resolution of the Directors authorising the call was passed. 10 Payment 35. Payment of a call may be made by instalments on the direction of the Directors. 36. If a sum called in respect of a Share is not paid before or on the day appointed for payment thereof, the person from whom the sum is due shall pay interest on the sum from the day payment is due to the time of the actual payment at such rate as the Directors may determine, but the Directors may waive payment of such interest wholly or in part. 37. Any sum payable in respect of a Share on issue or allotment or at any fixed date, whether in respect of the par value of the Share or premium or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a call and if it is not paid all the relevant provisions as to payment of interest, forfeiture or otherwise of these Articles shall apply as if such sum had become due and payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified. 38. The Directors may issue Shares with different terms as to the amount and times of payment of calls. Liability of joint holders 39. The joint holders of a Share shall be jointly and severally liable to pay calls in respect thereof. Interest 40. The Directors may, if they think fit, receive from any Member willing to advance the same, all or any part of the moneys uncalled and unpaid upon any Shares held by him; and may (until the amount would otherwise become payable) pay interest at such rate (not exceeding six per cent without the sanction of the Company in general meeting) as may be agreed upon between the Member paying the sum in advance and the Directors. FORFEITURE OF SHARES Notice 41. If a Member fails to pay any call or instalment of a call by the date it becomes due and payable, the Directors may, at any time thereafter while such call or instalment remains unpaid, give notice to the Member requiring payment of the unpaid portion of the call or instalment, together with any accrued interest and expenses incurred by the Company by reason of such non-payment. 11 42. The notice shall specify where and by what date (not being less than the Termination of 14 days’ from the date of the notice) payment is to be made and shall state that if it is not complied with the Shares in respect of which the call was made will be liable to be forfeited. The Directors may accept the surrTerminationer of any Share liable to be forfeited hereunder and, in such case, references to these Articles to forfeiture shall include surrTerminationer. Forfeiture for non-compliance 43. If such notice is not complied with, any Share in respect of which the notice was given may thereafter, before the payment of all calls or instalments and interest due in respect thereof has been made, be forfeited by a resolution of the Directors. Such forfeiture shall include all dividTerminations declared, other distributions or other monies payable in respect of the forfeited Shares and not paid before the forfeiture. Forfeited Shares 44. A forfeited Share may be sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed of upon such terms and in such manner as the Directors shall think fit, and at any time before a sale, re-allotment or disposition, the forfeiture may be cancelled on such terms as the Directors think fit. Continued liability for forfeited Member 45. A person whose Shares have been forfeited shall cease to be a Member in respect of the forfeited Shares, but shall remain liable to pay to the Company all moneys which at the date of forfeiture were presently payable by him in respect of the Shares together with interest at such rate as the Directors may determine from the date of forfeiture until payment, but his liability shall cease if and when the Company receives payment in full of all amounts due in respect of the Shares. The Company may enforce payment without being under any obligation to make any allowance for the value of the Shares forfeited. Evidence of forfeiture 46. An affidavit in writing by a Director or Secretary of the Company that a Share has been duly forfeited on a specified date, shall be conclusive evidence of the facts stated in it as against all persons claiming to be entitled to the Share. The Company may receive the consideration, if any, given for the Share on any sale, re-allotment or disposition thereof and may authorise some person to execute a Assignment of the Share in favour of the person to whom the Share is sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed of, and he shall thereupon be registered as the holder of the Share, and shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money (if any) nor shall his title to the Share be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings in reference to the forfeiture, sale, re-allotment or disposition of the Share. 12 47. The provisions of these Articles as to forfeiture shall apply in the case of non-payment of any sum which, by the terms of issue of a Share, becomes payable at a fixed time, whether on account of the par value of the Share, or by way of premium or otherwise, as if the same had been made payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified to the Member. INCREASE OF CAPITAL 48. The Company may from time to time by Ordinary Resolution increase its share capital by such sum, to be divided into new Shares of such par value, and with such rights, priorities and privileges attached thereto as the resolution shall prescribe. 49. Subject to any directions given by the Company in a general meeting, all new Shares shall be at the disposal of the Directors in accordance with these Articles. 50. The new Shares shall be subject to the same provisions of these Articles with reference to the payment of calls, lien, forfeiture, Assignment, transmission and otherwise, as the Shares in the original share capital. ALTERATION OF CAPITAL 51. The Company may from time to time by Ordinary Resolution: 51.1 consolidate and divide all or any of its share capital into Shares of larger par value than its existing Shares; 51.2 sub divide its existing Shares, or any of them, into Shares of smaller par value than is fixed by the Memorandum, subject nevertheless to the provisions of section 13 of the Law; 51.3 cancel any Shares which, at the date of the passing of the resolution, have not been taken or agreed to be taken by any person; and 51.4 convert all or any paid up Shares into stock, and reconvert all or any stock into paid up Shares of any denomination. 52. The Company may from time to time by Special Resolution: 52.1 divide its Shares into several classes and attach to such classes any preferential, deferred, or special rights or restrictions in accordance with these Articles; 52.2 change the currency denomination of its share capital; 13 52.3 reduce its share capital and any capital redemption reserve fund in any manner whatsoever; and 52.4 merge or consolidate with any one or more constituent companies (as defined in the Law). GENERAL MEETINGS Convening a meeting 53. The Directors may, whenever they think fit, convene an extraordinary general meeting. If at any time there are not sufficient Directors capable of acting to form a quorum, any Director, or any one or more Members holding in the aggregate not less than one third of the total issued share capital of the Company entitled to vote, may convene an extraordinary general meeting in the same manner as nearly as possible as that in which meetings may be convened by the Directors. Members’ requisition 54. The Directors shall, upon the requisition in writing of one or more Members holding in the aggregate not less than one tenth of such paid up capital of the Company as at the date of the requisition carries the right of voting at general meetings, convene an extraordinary general meeting. Any such requisition shall express the object of the meeting proposed to be called, and must be signed by the requisitionists and deposited at the Registered Office, and may consist of several documents in like form, each signed by one or more requisitionists. 55. If there are no Directors as at the date of the deposit of the Members’ requisition or if the Directors do not convene a general meeting within 21 days from the date of the deposit, the requisitionists or any or any of them or any other Member or Members holding in the aggregate not less than one tenth of such paid up capital of the Company as at the date of the requisition, may convene an extraordinary general meeting. A general meeting convened by requisitionists shall be convened in the same manner as nearly as possible as that in which general meetings are to be convened by the Directors. NOTICE OF GENERAL MEETINGS Length and form of notice 56. At least five clear days’ notice shall be given of any general meeting. Every notice shall specify the place, the day and the time of meeting and, in the case of special business, the general nature of the business to be conducted at the general meeting, and shall be given in the manner provided in these Articles or in such other manner (if any) as may be prescribed by the Company, to such persons as are entitled to receive such notices from the Company. A general meeting may be convened by such shorter notice, or without notice, by a majority in number of the Members having the right to attTermination and vote at the meeting, being a majority together holding not less than ninety-five percent in nominal value of the Shares giving that right. 14 Omission or non-receipt 57. The accidental omission to give notice of a meeting to, or the non-receipt of a notice of a meeting by, any Member entitled to receive notice shall not invalidate the proceedings at any meeting. PROCEEDINGS AT GENERAL MEETINGS 58. All business shall be deemed special that is transacted at an extraordinary general meeting. Quorum 59. No business shall be transacted at any general meeting unless a quorum of Members is present at the time that the meeting proceeds to business, but the absence of a quorum shall not preclude the appointment, choice or election of a chairman, which shall not be treated as part of the business of the Meeting. Save as herein otherwise provided, one or more Members holding in the aggregate not less than one third of the total issued share capital of the Company present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall be a quorum. Adjournment for lack of quorum 60. If within five minutes (or such longer time as the chairman of the meeting may determine to wait) after the time appointed for the meeting, a quorum is not present, the meeting, if convened upon the requisition of Members, shall be dissolved. In any other case, it shall stand adjourned to the same day in the next week, at the same time and place, and if at the adjourned meeting a quorum is not present within half an hour from the time appointed for the meeting, the Members present shall be a quorum. Meeting by telephone or other facilities 61. A meeting of the Members may be held by telephone, electronic or other communication facilities (including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, by telephone or video conferencing) by which all persons participating in the meeting can communicate with each other simultaneously and instantaneously, and participation in such a general meeting shall constitute presence in person at such meeting. 62. Any Director shall be entitled to attTermination and speak at any general meeting of the Company. 15 Appointment of chairman 63. The chairman (if any) of the Board of Directors shall preside as chairman at every general meeting of the Company. If there is no such chairman, or if at any meeting he is not present within five minutes after the time appointed for holding the meeting or is unwilling to act as chairman, the Directors present shall choose one of their number to act or, if only one Director is present, he shall preside as chairman if willing to act. If no Director is present, or if each of the Directors present declines to take the chair, the Members present and entitled to vote shall elect one of their number to be chairman. Adjournment of meeting 64. The chairman may, with the consent of a meeting at which a quorum is present (and shall if so directed by the meeting) adjourn the meeting from time to time and from place to place, but no business shall be transacted at any adjourned meeting other than the business left unfinished at the meeting from which the adjournment took place. When a meeting is adjourned for ten days or more, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given as in the case of an original meeting. Save as aforesaid, it shall not be necessary to give any notice of an adjournment or of the business to be transacted at an adjourned meeting. VOTING Ordinary Resolution Save where a Special Resolution or other greater majority is required by the Law or these Articles, any question proposed for consideration at any general meeting shall be decided by an Ordinary Resolution. Voting on a show of hands 65. At any general meeting, a resolution put to the vote of the meeting shall be decided on a show of hands, unless before or on the declaration of the result of the show of hands, or on the withdrawal of any other demand for a poll. Demand for poll 66. A poll is demanded by: 66.1 the chairman of the meeting; or 66.2 at least three Members present in person or by proxy; or 66.3 any Member or Members present in person or by proxy and holding collectively not less than one tenth of the total voting rights of all the Members having the right to vote at such meeting; or 16 66.4 a Member or Members present in person or by proxy holding Shares conferring the right to vote at such meeting, being Shares on which an aggregate sum has been paid up equal to not less than one tenth of the total sum paid up on all such Shares conferring such right. 67. Unless a poll is duly demanded and the demand is not withdrawn, a declaration by the chairman that a resolution has, on a show of hands, been carried or carried unanimously, or by a particular majority, or lost and an entry to that effect in the minutes of the proceedings of the Company shall be conclusive evidence of that fact, without proof of the number or proportion of the votes recorded in favour of, or against, that resolution. The demand for a poll may be withdrawn by the person or any persons making it at any time prior to the declaration of the result of the poll. 68. If a poll is duly demanded, it shall be taken in such manner as the chairman directs, and the result of the poll shall be deemed to be the resolution of the meeting at which the poll was demanded. 69. In the case of an equality of votes at a general meeting, whether on a show of hands or on a poll, the chairman of the meeting at which the show of hands takes place or at which the poll is demanded, shall not be entitled to a second or casting vote and the resolution shall fail. 70. A poll demanded on the election of a chairman or on a question of adjournment shall be taken forthwith. A poll demanded on any other question shall be taken in such manner and either forthwith or at such time later in the meeting as the chairman of the meeting shall direct. 71. The demand for a poll shall not prevent the continuance of a meeting for the transaction of any business other than the question on which the poll has been demanded and it may be withdrawn at any time before the close of the meeting or the taking of the poll, whichever is the earlier. Voting on a poll 72. On a poll votes may be cast either personally or by proxy. 73. A person entitled to more than one vote on a poll need not use all his votes or cast all the votes he uses in the same way. 74. On a show of hands, every Member present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall have one vote. On a poll, every Member present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall have one vote for each Share of which he is the registered holder. 17 75. In the case of joint holders of a Share, the vote of the senior who tTerminationers a vote, whether in person or by proxy, shall be accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint holders; and for this purpose seniority shall be determined by the order in which the names stand in the Register of Members in respect of the joint holding. 76. A Member of unsound mind, or, in respect of whom an order has been made by any court having jurisdiction in lunacy, may vote, whether on a show of hands or on a poll, by his receiver, committee, curator bonis or other person of similar nature appointed by such court, and any such receiver, committee, curator bonis or other person may vote by proxy and may otherwise act and be treated as such Member for the purpose of the general meetings. 77. No Member, unless the Directors otherwise determine, shall be entitled to vote at any general meeting, unless all calls or other sums presently payable by him in respect of Shares in the Company have been paid. 78. No objection shall be raised as to the qualification of any voter or as to whether any votes have been properly counted except at the general meeting or adjourned general meeting at which the vote objected to is given or tTerminationered and every vote not disallowed at the meeting shall be valid. Any objection made in due time and in accordance with these Articles shall be referred to the chairman whose decision shall be final and conclusive. Shareholder Restricted Matters 78A.

Directors may from time to time and at any time by power of attorney or otherwise appoint any company, firm or person or fluctuating body of persons, whether nominated directly or indirectly by the Directors, to be the attorney or attorneys of the Company for such purposes and with such powers, authorities and discretions (not exceeding those vested in or exercisable by the Directors under these Articles) and for such period and subject to such conditions as they may think fit, and any such power of attorney may contain such provisions for the protection and convenience of persons dealing with any such attorney and of such attorney as the Directors may think fit and may also authorise any such attorney to delegate all or any of the powers, authorities and discretions vested in him. 119.

Such appointment or removal shall be by notice to the Registered Office signed by the Director making or revoking the appointment or in any other manner approved by the Directors, and shall be effective on the date the notice is served and the alternate shall be notified of such appointment or revocation.

An alternate Director shall be deemed for all purposes to be a Director and shall alone be responsible for his own acts and defaults and shall not be deemed to be the agent of the Director appointing him. The signature of an alternate to any resolution in writing of the Director or a committee there shall, unless the terms of the appointment provides to the contrary, be as effective as the signature of the Director or Directors to whom he is alternate. 28 Committees of Directors 124. The Directors may delegate any of their powers to committees consisting of such member or members of their body as they think fit; any committee so formed shall, in the exercise of the powers so delegated, conform to any regulations that may be imposed on it by the Directors. 125.

A committee may meet and adjourn as it thinks proper. Questions arising at any meeting shall be determined by a majority of votes of the members present and in case of an equality of votes the chairman shall not have a second or casting vote and the motion shall be deemed to have been lost. Officers 127. The Directors may appoint a Secretary and such other officers as they may from time to time consider necessary upon such terms as to duration of office, remuneration and otherwise as they may think fit. Such Secretary or other officers need not be Directors and in the case of the other officers may be ascribed such titles as the Directors may decide and the Directors may revoke or terminate any such election or appointment. Any such revocation or termination shall be without prejudice to any claim for any damages that such officer may have against the Company or the Company may have against such officer for any breach of any contract of service between him and the Company which may be involved in such revocation or termination. Save as provided in the Law or these Articles, the powers and duties of the officers of the Company shall be such (if any) as are determined from time to time by the Directors.

The Seal shall only be used by the authority of the Directors and in the presence of a Director or the Secretary or such other person as the Directors may by resolution appoint for this purpose, and every instrument to which the Seal affixed shall be signed by the relevant person. Notwithstanding the above, annual returns and notices filed under the Law may be executed either as a deed or under Seal and in either case without the need for the authority of a resolution of the Directors. 30 Duplicate Seal 132. The Company may maintain in any place or places outside the Cayman Islands a facsimile of any Seal and such facsimile seal shall be affixed in the same way as if it were the Seal. Execution of deeds 133.

DIVIDTerminationS Payment of DividTerminations 134. The Directors may from time to time declare dividTerminations to be paid to the Members according to their rights and interests, including such interim dividTerminations as appear to the Directors to be justified by the position of the Company. The Directors may also pay any fixed cash dividTermination which is payable on any Shares of the Company half yearly or on such other dates, whenever the position of the Company, in the opinion of the Directors, justifies such payment. 135. No dividTermination shall be paid otherwise than out of profits or out of monies otherwise available for dividTermination in accordance with the Law. Calculation of DividTerminations 136. Subject to the rights of Members, if any, entitled to Shares with special rights as to dividTerminations, all dividTerminations shall be declared and paid according to the amount paid up on the Shares in respect of which the dividTermination is paid and any dividTermination on any class of Shares not fully paid shall be declared and paid according to the amounts paid on the Shares of that class, but if and so long as nothing is paid up on any of the Shares in the Company, dividTerminations may be declared and paid according to the number of Shares. No amount paid on a Share in advance of calls shall, while carrying interest, be treated for the purposes of this Article as paid on the Share. DividTerminations may be apportioned and paid pro rata according to the amounts paid-up on the Shares during any portion or portions of the period in respect of which the dividTermination is paid. 31 Deductions 137. The Directors may deduct from any dividTermination, distribution or other monies payable to a Member by the Company on or in respect of any Shares all sums of money (if any) presently payable by him to the Company on account of calls or otherwise in respect of Shares of the Company. Joint Holders 138. If several persons are registered as joint holders of any Share, any of them may give effectual receipts for any dividTermination or other money payable on or in respect of the Share. Payment method 139. Any dividTermination may be paid by cheque or warrant sent through the post to the address of the Member or person entitled thereto in the Register of Members or, in the case of joint holders addressed to the holder whose name stands first in the Register of Members in respect of the Shares at his registered address as appearing on the Register of Members or to such person and such address as the Member or person entitled or such joint holders as the case may be may direct in writing. Every such cheque or warrant shall, unless the holder or joint holders may in writing direct, be made payable to the order of the person to whom it is sent or to the order of the holder or, in the case of joint holders, to the order of the holder whose name stands first in the Register of Members in respect of such Shares, and shall be sent at his or their risk and payment of the cheque or warrant by the bank on which it is drawn shall constitute a good discharge to the Company. Any one of two or more joint holders may give effectual receipts for any dividTerminations, distributions or other monies payable or property distributable in respect of the Shares held by such joint holders. Satisfaction by distribution of specific assets 140. The Directors may declare that any dividTermination or distribution is paid wholly or partly by the distribution of specific assets and, in particular, of paid up shares, debentures or debenture stock of any other company or in any one or more of such ways, and where any difficulty arises in regard to such dividTermination or distribution, the Directors may settle the same as they think expedient, and in particular may issue fractional Shares or ignore fractions altogether and may fix the value for dividTermination or distribution of such specific assets or any part thereof and may determine that cash payments shall be made to any Members upon the basis of the value so fixed in order to secure equality of distribution, and may vest any such specific assets in trustees as may seem expedient to the Directors. 32 No interest 141. No dividTermination or other distribution or other monies payable by the Company on or in respect of any Share shall bear interest against the Company. Unclaimed dividTerminations 142. All unclaimed dividTerminations or distributions may be invested or otherwise made use of by the Directors for the benefit of the Company until claimed. Any dividTermination or distribution unclaimed by a Member six years after the dividTermination or distribution payment date shall be forfeited and revert to the Company. RESERVES 143. The Directors may, before declaring any dividTermination or distribution, set aside such sums as they think proper as a reserve or reserves which shall, at the discretion of the Directors, be applicable for meeting contingencies, or for equalising dividTerminations, or for any other purpose of the Company, and pTerminationing such application may, in their discretion, be employed in the business of the Company or be invested in such manner as the Directors may from time to time think fit. The Directors may also without placing the same to reserve carry forward any sums which they think it prudent not to distribute. CAPITALISATION OF PROFITS Capitalisation 144. The Directors may capitalise any sum standing to the credit of any of the Company’s reserve accounts which are available for distribution (including its Share Premium Account and capital redemption reserve fund, subject to the Law) or any sum standing to the credit of the profit and loss account or otherwise available for distribution and to appropriate such sums to Members in the proportions in which such sum would have been divisible amongst them had the same been a distribution of profits by way of dividTermination and to apply such sum on their behalf in paying up in full unissued Shares for allotment and distribution credited as fully paid-up to and amongst them in the proportion aforesaid. Authorisation 145. Where any difficulty arises in regard to any distribution under the last preceding Article, the Directors may settle the same as they think expedient and, in particular, may authorise any person to sell and Assignment any fractions or may resolve that the distribution should be as nearly as may be practicable in the correct proportion but not exactly so or may ignore fractions altogether, and may determine that cash payments should be made to any Members in order to adjust the rights of all parties, as may seem expedient to the Directors. The Directors may appoint any person to sign on behalf of the persons entitled to participate in the distribution any contract necessary or desirable for giving effect thereto and such appointment shall be effective and binding upon the Members. 33 SHARE PREMIUM ACCOUNT 146. The Directors shall in accordance with the Law establish a Share Premium Account and shall carry to the credit of such account from time to time a sum equal to the amount or value of the premium paid on the issue of any Share. 147. There shall be debited to any Share Premium Account on the redemption or purchase of a Share the difference between the nominal value of such Share and the redemption or purchase price provided always that at the discretion of the Directors such sum may be paid out of the profits of the Company or, if permitted by the Law, out of capital. ACCOUNTING RECORDS Books of account 148. The Directors shall cause to be kept accounting records sufficient to give a true and fair view of the state of the Company's affairs and to show and explain its transactions and otherwise in accordance with the Law. Inspection by Members 149. The accounting records shall be kept at the Registered Office or at such other place or places as the Directors think fit, and shall at all times be open to inspection by the Directors. No Member (who is not also a Director) shall have any right to inspect any accounting record or book or document of the Company except as conferred by law or authorised by the Directors or by the Members by Ordinary Resolution. Records and audit 150. From time to time the Company in general meeting may determine (or revoke, alter or amTermination any such determination) or, failing such determination, the Directors may determine (or revoke, alter or amTermination any such determination): 150.1 that the accounts of the Company be audited and the appointment of the Auditors; 150.2 that there be prepared and sent to each Member and other person entitled thereto a profit and loss account, a balance sheet, group accounts and/or reports for such period and on such terms as they may determine; and 150.3 that there be laid before the Company in general meeting a copy of every balance sheet together with a copy of the Auditor's report. 34 SERVICE OF NOTICES AND DOCUMENTS Form and delivery of notices 151. Notices or other documents or communications may be given to any Member by the Company either personally or by sTerminationing it by courier, post, fax or email to him to his registered address, or (if he has no registered address) to the address, if any, supplied by him to the Company for the giving of notices to him. Any notice shall be deemed to be effected: 151.1 if delivered personally or sent by courier, by properly addressing and prepaying a letter containing the notice; and to have been effected, in the case of a notice of a meeting, when delivered; 151.2 if sent by post, by properly addressing, prepaying, and posting a letter containing the notice (by airmail if available) and to have been effected, in the case of a notice of a meeting, at the Termination of three days after it was posted; and 151.3 if sent by fax or email by properly addressing and sTerminationing such notice through the appropriate transmitting medium and to have been effected on the day the same is sent. 152.

A notice may be given by the Company to the person entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a Member by sTerminationing it through the post in a prepaid letter addressed to them by name, or by the title of representatives of the deceased, or trustee of the bankrupt, or by any like description, at the address, if any, supplied for the purpose by the persons claiming to be so entitled, or (until such an address has been so supplied) by giving the notice in any manner in which the same might have been given if the death or bankruptcy had not occurred. 154. Notice of every general meeting shall be given in any manner hereinbefore authorised to: 154.1 every Member entitled to vote except those Members entitled to vote who (having no registered address) have not supplied to the Company an address for the giving of notices to them; and 154.2 every person entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a Member, who, but for his death or bankruptcy would be entitled to receive notice of the meeting. 155. No other persons shall be entitled to receive notices of general meeting. 35 WINDING UP Method of winding up 156. Subject to the rights attaching to any Shares, if the Company shall be wound up, the liquidator may, with the sanction of a Special Resolution and any other sanction required by the Law or these Articles, divide amongst the Members in kind the whole or any part of the assets of the Company (whether they shall consist of property of the same kind or not) and may for such purpose set such value as he deems fair upon any property to be divided as aforesaid and may determine how such division shall be carried out as between the Members or different classes of Members. The liquidator may, with the like sanction, vest the whole or any part of such assets in trustees upon such trusts for the benefit of the contributories as the liquidator, with the like sanction, shall think fit, but so that no Member shall be compelled to accept any asset upon which there is any liability. Distribution of assets 157.

And if in a winding up the assets available for distribution amongst the Members shall be more than sufficient to repay the whole of the capital paid up at the commencement of the winding up, the excess shall be distributed amongst the Members in proportion to the capital paid up at the commencement of the winding up on the Shares held by them respectively. This Article is to be without prejudice to the rights of the holders of Shares issued upon special terms and conditions. Indemnification Indemnification and limitation of liability 158.

To the extent that any Indemnified Person is entitled to claim an Indemnification pursuant to these Articles in respect of amounts paid or discharged by him, the relative Indemnification shall take effect as an obligation of the Company to reimburse the person making such payment or effecting such discharge.

Advance of legal fees 163. Expenses incurred in defTerminationing any civil or criminal action or proceeding for which indemnification is required pursuant to these Articles shall be paid by the Company in advance of the final disposition of such action or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnified Person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that the Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified pursuant to these Articles. Each Member of the Company shall be deemed to have acknowledged and agreed that the advances of funds may be made by the Company as aforesaid, and when made by the Company under this Article are made to meet expTerminationitures incurred for the purpose of enabling such Indemnified Person to properly perform his or her duties to the Company. 37 CONTINUATION 164.

TRANSMISSION OF SHARES Transmission of Shares 21. If a Member dies, the survivor or survivors (where he was a joint holder), and the legal personal representative (where he was sole holder), shall be the only person recognised by the Company as having any title to the Share. The estate of a deceased Member is not thereby released from any liability in respect of any Share held by him, whether solely or jointly. For the purpose of this Article, legal personal representative means the person to whom probate or letters of administration has or have been granted in the Cayman Islands or, if there is no such person, such other person as the Directors may in their absolute discretion determine to be the person recognised by the Company for the purpose of this Article.

Any person becoming entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a Member or otherwise by operation of Governing Law may elect, upon such evidence being produced as may be required by the Directors as to his entitlement, either be registered himself as a Member in respect of the Share or, instead of being registered himself, to make such Assignment of the Share as the deceased or bankrupt Member could have made. 7 Manner of election 23. If the person so becoming entitled elects to be registered himself, he shall deliver or sTermination to the Company a notice in writing signed by him stating that he so elects. If he shall elect to Assignment the Shares, he shall signify his election by signing an instrument of Assignment of such Shares in favour of his Assignmentee. All the limitations, restrictions and provisions of these Articles relating to the right to Assignment and the registration of Assignments of Shares shall be applicable to any such notice or instrument of Assignment as aforesaid as if the death of the Member or other event giving rise to the transmission had not occurred and the notice or instrument of Assignment was an instrument of Assignment signed by such Member. Rights of persons entitled on transmission 24. A person becoming entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of the Member (or otherwise by operation of Governing Law), upon such evidence being produced as may be required by the Directors as to his entitlement, shall be entitled to the same dividTerminations and other monies payable in respect of the Share as he would be entitled if he were the holder of such Share. However, he shall not be entitled, until he becomes registered as the holder of such Share, to receive notices of or to attTermination or vote at general meetings of the Company or (except as aforesaid) to exercise any other rights or privileges of a Member. The Directors may at any time give notice requiring such person to elect either to be registered himself or to Assignment the Share and, if the notice is not complied with within sixty days, the Directors may thereafter withhold payment of all dividTerminations and other monies payable in respect of the Shares until the requirements of the notice have been complied with. REDEMPTION AND PURCHASE OF SHARES 25. Subject to the provisions of the Law and the Memorandum, the Company may: 25.1 purchase its own Shares (including any redeemable Shares) in such manner and on such terms as the Directors may agree with the relevant Member unless following such purchase there would no longer be any issued Shares and may make payment for such purchase or for any redemption of Shares in any manner authorised by the Law, including out of capital; and 25.2 reduce its share capital and any capital redemption reserve fund in any manner whatsoever. 8 VARIATION OF SHARE RIGHTS Variation of class rights 26. If at any time the share capital is divided into different classes of Shares, all or any of the special rights attached to any class of Shares (unless otherwise provided by the terms of issue of the Shares of that class) may be varied or abrogated with the consent in writing of the holders of not less than two thirds of the issued Shares of that class or with the sanction of a resolution passed by the holders of not less than two thirds of the issued Shares of that class as may be present in person or by proxy at a separate general meeting of the holders of the Shares of that class. To any such separate general meeting, all of the provisions of these Articles relating to general meetings shall mutatis mutandis apply, but so that the necessary quorum shall be any one or more persons holding or representing by proxy not less than one third of the issued Shares of the class and that any holder of Shares of the relevant class present in person or by proxy may demand a poll. Treatment of classes 27. For the purpose of a separate class meeting, the Directors may treat two or more of all classes of Shares as forming one class if they consider that such class of Shares would be affected in the same way by the proposals under consideration. Effect of Share issue on class rights 28. The rights conferred upon the holders of any Shares shall not, unless otherwise expressly provided in the rights attaching to such Shares, be deemed to be altered by the creation or issue of further Shares ranking pari passu therewith. NON-RECOGNITION OF TRUSTS 29. Except as required by the Law or these Articles, or under an order of a court of competent jurisdiction, the Company shall not be bound by or compelled to recognise in any way, even when notice thereof is given to it, any equitable, contingent, future or partial interest in any Share, or any other rights in respect of any Share other than an absolute right to the entirety thereof in the registered holder. 9 LIEN Lien generally 30. The Company shall have a first and paramount lien on every Share (not being a fully paid Share) for all moneys (whether presently payable or not) called or payable at a date fixed by or in accordance with the terms of issue of such Share in respect of that Share, and the Company shall also have a first and paramount lien on every Share (other than a fully paid up Share) standing registered in the name of a Member, whether singly or jointly with any other person for all debts and liabilities of a Member or his estate to the Company, whether the same shall have been incurred before or after notice to the Company of any interest of any person other than such Member, and whether the time for the payment or discharge of the same shall have actually arrived or not, and notwithstanding that the same are joint debts or liabilities of such Member or his estate and any other person, whether a Member or not. The Directors may at any time, either generally or in any particular case, waive any lien that has arisen or declare any Share to be wholly or in part exempt from the provisions of this Article. The Company's lien, if any, on a Share shall extTermination to all dividTerminations payable thereon. Enforcement 31. The Company may sell, in such manner as the Directors think fit, any Share on which the Company has a lien, provided a sum in respect of which the lien exists is presently payable, and is not paid within fourteen days after a notice in writing has been given to the registered holder  for the time being of the Share, demanding payment of the sum presently payable and giving notice of the intention to sell in default of such payment. Completion of sale 32. For giving effect to any such sale, the Directors may authorise any person to Assignment the Share sold to the purchaser thereof. The purchaser shall be registered as the holder of the Share comprised in any such Assignment and he shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money, nor shall his title to the Share be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings relating to the sale. Application of proceeds 33. The net proceeds of such sale shall be applied in payment or discharge of the debt or liability in respect of which the lien exists and as is presently payable, and any balance shall (subject to a like lien for debts or liabilities not presently payable as existed upon the Shares prior to the sale) be paid to the person who was the registered holder of the Share immediately before such sale. CALLS ON SHARES Calls on Shares generally 34. The Directors may from time to time make calls upon the Members in respect of any moneys unpaid on their Shares (whether in respect of the par value of the Shares or premium or otherwise and not, by the terms of issue thereof, made payable at a future date fixed by or in accordance with such terms of issue); and each Member shall (subject to the Company serving upon him at least 14 days’ notice specifying the time or times and place of payment) pay to the Company at the time or times and place so specified the amount called on his Shares. A call may be revoked or postponed by the Directors wholly or in part as the Directors may determine. A call shall be deemed to have been made at the time when the resolution of the Directors authorising the call was passed. 10 Payment 35. Payment of a call may be made by instalments on the direction of the Directors. 36. If a sum called in respect of a Share is not paid before or on the day appointed for payment thereof, the person from whom the sum is due shall pay interest on the sum from the day payment is due to the time of the actual payment at such rate as the Directors may determine, but the Directors may waive payment of such interest wholly or in part. 37. Any sum payable in respect of a Share on issue or allotment or at any fixed date, whether in respect of the par value of the Share or premium or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a call and if it is not paid all the relevant provisions as to payment of interest, forfeiture or otherwise of these Articles shall apply as if such sum had become due and payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified. 38. The Directors may issue Shares with different terms as to the amount and times of payment of calls. Liability of joint holders 39. The joint holders of a Share shall be jointly and severally liable to pay calls in respect thereof. Interest 40. The Directors may, if they think fit, receive from any Member willing to advance the same, all or any part of the moneys uncalled and unpaid upon any Shares held by him; and may (until the amount would otherwise become payable) pay interest at such rate (not exceeding six per cent without the sanction of the Company in general meeting) as may be agreed upon between the Member paying the sum in advance and the Directors. FORFEITURE OF SHARES Notice 41. If a Member fails to pay any call or instalment of a call by the date it becomes due and payable, the Directors may, at any time thereafter while such call or instalment remains unpaid, give notice to the Member requiring payment of the unpaid portion of the call or instalment, together with any accrued interest and expenses incurred by the Company by reason of such non-payment. 11 42. The notice shall specify where and by what date (not being less than the Termination of 14 days’ from the date of the notice) payment is to be made and shall state that if it is not complied with the Shares in respect of which the call was made will be liable to be forfeited. The Directors may accept the surrTerminationer of any Share liable to be forfeited hereunder and, in such case, references to these Articles to forfeiture shall include surrTerminationer. Forfeiture for non-compliance 43. If such notice is not complied with, any Share in respect of which the notice was given may thereafter, before the payment of all calls or instalments and interest due in respect thereof has been made, be forfeited by a resolution of the Directors. Such forfeiture shall include all dividTerminations declared, other distributions or other monies payable in respect of the forfeited Shares and not paid before the forfeiture. Forfeited Shares 44. A forfeited Share may be sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed of upon such terms and in such manner as the Directors shall think fit, and at any time before a sale, re-allotment or disposition, the forfeiture may be cancelled on such terms as the Directors think fit. Continued liability for forfeited Member 45.

The Company may enforce payment without being under any obligation to make any allowance for the value of the Shares forfeited. Evidence of forfeiture 46.

The provisions of these Articles as to forfeiture shall apply in the case of non-payment of any sum which, by the terms of issue of a Share, becomes payable at a fixed time, whether on account of the par value of the Share, or by way of premium or otherwise, as if the same had been made payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified to the Member. INCREASE OF CAPITAL 48. The Company may from time to time by Ordinary Resolution increase its share capital by such sum, to be divided into new Shares of such par value, and with such rights, priorities and privileges attached thereto as the resolution shall prescribe. 49. Subject to any directions given by the Company in a general meeting, all new Shares shall be at the disposal of the Directors in accordance with these Articles. 50. The new Shares shall be subject to the same provisions of these Articles with reference to the payment of calls, lien, forfeiture, Assignment, transmission and otherwise, as the Shares in the original share capital. ALTERATION OF CAPITAL 51. The Company may from time to time by Ordinary Resolution: 51.1 consolidate and divide all or any of its share capital into Shares of larger par value than its existing Shares; 51.2 sub divide its existing Shares, or any of them, into Shares of smaller par value than is fixed by the Memorandum, subject nevertheless to the provisions of section 13 of the Law; 51.3 cancel any Shares which, at the date of the passing of the resolution, have not been taken or agreed to be taken by any person; and 51.4 convert all or any paid up Shares into stock, and reconvert all or any stock into paid up Shares of any denomination. 52.

In any other case, it shall stand adjourned to the same day in the next week, at the same time and place, and if at the adjourned meeting a quorum is not present within half an hour from the time appointed for the meeting, the Members present shall be a quorum.

Unless a poll is duly demanded and the demand is not withdrawn, a declaration by the chairman that a resolution has, on a show of hands, been carried or carried unanimously, or by a particular majority, or lost and an entry to that effect in the minutes of the proceedings of the Company shall be conclusive evidence of that fact, without proof of the number or proportion of the votes recorded in favour of, or against, that resolution. The demand for a poll may be withdrawn by the person or any persons making it at any time prior to the declaration of the result of the poll. 68. If a poll is duly demanded, it shall be taken in such manner as the chairman directs, and the result of the poll shall be deemed to be the resolution of the meeting at which the poll was demanded. 69.

In the case of joint holders of a Share, the vote of the senior who tTerminationers a vote, whether in person or by proxy, shall be accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint holders; and for this purpose seniority shall be determined by the order in which the names stand in the Register of Members in respect of the joint holding. 76. A Member of unsound mind, or, in respect of whom an order has been made by any court having jurisdiction in lunacy, may vote, whether on a show of hands or on a poll, by his receiver, committee, curator bonis or other person of similar nature appointed by such court, and any such receiver, committee, curator bonis or other person may vote by proxy and may otherwise act and be treated as such Member for the purpose of the general meetings. 77. No Member, unless the Directors otherwise determine, shall be entitled to vote at any general meeting, unless all calls or other sums presently payable by him in respect of Shares in the Company have been paid. 78. No objection shall be raised as to the qualification of any voter or as to whether any votes have been properly counted except at the general meeting or adjourned general meeting at which the vote objected to is given or tTerminationered and every vote not disallowed at the meeting shall be valid.

The signature of an alternate to any resolution in writing of the Director or a committee there shall, unless the terms of the appointment provides to the contrary, be as effective as the signature of the Director or Directors to whom he is alternate. 28 Committees of Directors 124. The Directors may delegate any of their powers to committees consisting of such member or members of their body as they think fit; any committee so formed shall, in the exercise of the powers so delegated, conform to any regulations that may be imposed on it by the Directors. 125. A committee may elect a chairman of its meetings; if no such chairman is elected, or if at any meeting the chairman is not present within five minutes after the time appointed for holding the same, the members present may choose one of their number to be chairman of the meeting. 126. A committee may meet and adjourn as it thinks proper. Questions arising at any meeting shall be determined by a majority of votes of the members present and in case of an equality of votes the chairman shall not have a second or casting vote and the motion shall be deemed to have been lost. Officers 127. The Directors may appoint a Secretary and such other officers as they may from time to time consider necessary upon such terms as to duration of office, remuneration and otherwise as they may think fit. Such Secretary or other officers need not be Directors and in the case of the other officers may be ascribed such titles as the Directors may decide and the Directors may revoke or terminate any such election or appointment. Any such revocation or termination shall be without prejudice to any claim for any damages that such officer may have against the Company or the Company may have against such officer for any breach of any contract of service between him and the Company which may be involved in such revocation or termination. Save as provided in the Law or these Articles, the powers and duties of the officers of the Company shall be such (if any) as are determined from time to time by the Directors. DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION Remuneration 128. The remuneration to be paid to the Directors, if any, shall be determined by the Company in general meeting or, in the absence of such a determination, by the Directors. Expenses 129. Each Director shall also be entitled to be paid his reasonable travelling, hotel and other expenses properly incurred by him in connection with his attTerminationance at meetings of the Directors, committees of the Directors or general meetings of the Company, or otherwise in connection with the business of the Company, or to receive a fixed allowance in respect thereof as may be determined by the Directors, or a combination partly of one such method and partly the other. 29 Additional remuneration 130. The Directors may by resolution approve additional remuneration to any Director for services which in the opinion of the Directors go beyond the ordinary duties of a Director, and such extra remuneration shall be in addition to any remuneration provided for, by or pursuant to any other Article. SEALS AND DEEDS Use of Seal 131. The Directors may determine that the Company shall have a Seal, and if they so determine, shall provide for the safe custody of the Seal. The Seal shall only be used by the authority of the Directors and in the presence of a Director or the Secretary or such other person as the Directors may by resolution appoint for this purpose, and every instrument to which the Seal affixed shall be signed by the relevant person. Notwithstanding the above, annual returns and notices filed under the Law may be executed either as a deed or under Seal and in either case without the need for the authority of a resolution of the Directors. 30 Duplicate Seal 132. The Company may maintain in any place or places outside the Cayman Islands a facsimile of any Seal and such facsimile seal shall be affixed in the same way as if it were the Seal. Execution of deeds 133. In accordance with the Law, the Company may execute any deed or other instrument (which would otherwise be required to be executed under Seal) by the signature of such deed or instrument as a deed by a Director or by the Secretary of the Company or by such other person as the Directors may appoint or by any other person or attorney on behalf of the Company appointed by a deed or other instrument executed as a deed by a Director or the Secretary or such other person as aforesaid. DIVIDTerminationS Payment of DividTerminations 134. The Directors may from time to time declare dividTerminations to be paid to the Members according to their rights and interests, including such interim dividTerminations as appear to the Directors to be justified by the position of the Company. The Directors may also pay any fixed cash dividTermination which is payable on any Shares of the Company half yearly or on such other dates, whenever the position of the Company, in the opinion of the Directors, justifies such payment. 135. No dividTermination shall be paid otherwise than out of profits or out of monies otherwise available for dividTermination in accordance with the Law. Calculation of DividTerminations 136. Subject to the rights of Members, if any, entitled to Shares with special rights as to dividTerminations, all dividTerminations shall be declared and paid according to the amount paid up on the Shares in respect of which the dividTermination is paid and any dividTermination on any class of Shares not fully paid shall be declared and paid according to the amounts paid on the Shares of that class, but if and so long as nothing is paid up on any of the Shares in the Company, dividTerminations may be declared and paid according to the number of Shares. No amount paid on a Share in advance of calls shall, while carrying interest, be treated for the purposes of this Article as paid on the Share. DividTerminations may be apportioned and paid pro rata according to the amounts paid-up on the Shares during any portion or portions of the period in respect of which the dividTermination is paid. 31 Deductions 137. The Directors may deduct from any dividTermination, distribution or other monies payable to a Member by the Company on or in respect of any Shares all sums of money (if any) presently payable by him to the Company on account of calls or otherwise in respect of Shares of the Company. Joint Holders 138. If several persons are registered as joint holders of any Share, any of them may give effectual receipts for any dividTermination or other money payable on or in respect of the Share. Payment method 139. Any dividTermination may be paid by cheque or warrant sent through the post to the address of the Member or person entitled thereto in the Register of Members or, in the case of joint holders addressed to the holder whose name stands first in the Register of Members in respect of the Shares at his registered address as appearing on the Register of Members or to such person and such address as the Member or person entitled or such joint holders as the case may be may direct in writing. Every such cheque or warrant shall, unless the holder or joint holders may in writing direct, be made payable to the order of the person to whom it is sent or to the order of the holder or, in the case of joint holders, to the order of the holder whose name stands first in the Register of Members in respect of such Shares, and shall be sent at his or their risk and payment of the cheque or warrant by the bank on which it is drawn shall constitute a good discharge to the Company. Any one of two or more joint holders may give effectual receipts for any dividTerminations, distributions or other monies payable or property distributable in respect of the Shares held by such joint holders. Satisfaction by distribution of specific assets 140. The Directors may declare that any dividTermination or distribution is paid wholly or partly by the distribution of specific assets and, in particular, of paid up shares, debentures or debenture stock of any other company or in any one or more of such ways, and where any difficulty arises in regard to such dividTermination or distribution, the Directors may settle the same as they think expedient, and in particular may issue fractional Shares or ignore fractions altogether and may fix the value for dividTermination or distribution of such specific assets or any part thereof and may determine that cash payments shall be made to any Members upon the basis of the value so fixed in order to secure equality of distribution, and may vest any such specific assets in trustees as may seem expedient to the Directors. 32 No interest 141. No dividTermination or other distribution or other monies payable by the Company on or in respect of any Share shall bear interest against the Company. Unclaimed dividTerminations 142. All unclaimed dividTerminations or distributions may be invested or otherwise made use of by the Directors for the benefit of the Company until claimed. Any dividTermination or distribution unclaimed by a Member six years after the dividTermination or distribution payment date shall be forfeited and revert to the Company. RESERVES 143. The Directors may, before declaring any dividTermination or distribution, set aside such sums as they think proper as a reserve or reserves which shall, at the discretion of the Directors, be applicable for meeting contingencies, or for equalising dividTerminations, or for any other purpose of the Company, and pTerminationing such application may, in their discretion, be employed in the business of the Company or be invested in such manner as the Directors may from time to time think fit. The Directors may also without placing the same to reserve carry forward any sums which they think it prudent not to distribute. CAPITALISATION OF PROFITS Capitalisation 144. The Directors may capitalise any sum standing to the credit of any of the Company’s reserve accounts which are available for distribution (including its Share Premium Account and capital redemption reserve fund, subject to the Law) or any sum standing to the credit of the profit and loss account or otherwise available for distribution and to appropriate such sums to Members in the proportions in which such sum would have been divisible amongst them had the same been a distribution of profits by way of dividTermination and to apply such sum on their behalf in paying up in full unissued Shares for allotment and distribution credited as fully paid-up to and amongst them in the proportion aforesaid. Authorisation 145. Where any difficulty arises in regard to any distribution under the last preceding Article, the Directors may settle the same as they think expedient and, in particular, may authorise any person to sell and Assignment any fractions or may resolve that the distribution should be as nearly as may be practicable in the correct proportion but not exactly so or may ignore fractions altogether, and may determine that cash payments should be made to any Members in order to adjust the rights of all parties, as may seem expedient to the Directors. The Directors may appoint any person to sign on behalf of the persons entitled to participate in the distribution any contract necessary or desirable for giving effect thereto and such appointment shall be effective and binding upon the Members. 33 SHARE PREMIUM ACCOUNT 146. The Directors shall in accordance with the Law establish a Share Premium Account and shall carry to the credit of such account from time to time a sum equal to the amount or value of the premium paid on the issue of any Share. 147. There shall be debited to any Share Premium Account on the redemption or purchase of a Share the difference between the nominal value of such Share and the redemption or purchase price provided always that at the discretion of the Directors such sum may be paid out of the profits of the Company or, if permitted by the Law, out of capital. ACCOUNTING RECORDS Books of account 148. The Directors shall cause to be kept accounting records sufficient to give a true and fair view of the state of the Company's affairs and to show and explain its transactions and otherwise in accordance with the Law. Inspection by Members 149. The accounting records shall be kept at the Registered Office or at such other place or places as the Directors think fit, and shall at all times be open to inspection by the Directors. No Member (who is not also a Director) shall have any right to inspect any accounting record or book or document of the Company except as conferred by law or authorised by the Directors or by the Members by Ordinary Resolution. Records and audit 150. From time to time the Company in general meeting may determine (or revoke, alter or amTermination any such determination) or, failing such determination, the Directors may determine (or revoke, alter or amTermination any such determination): 150.1 that the accounts of the Company be audited and the appointment of the Auditors; 150.2 that there be prepared and sent to each Member and other person entitled thereto a profit and loss account, a balance sheet, group accounts and/or reports for such period and on such terms as they may determine; and 150.3 that there be laid before the Company in general meeting a copy of every balance sheet together with a copy of the Auditor's report. 34 SERVICE OF NOTICES AND DOCUMENTS Form and delivery of notices 151. Notices or other documents or communications may be given to any Member by the Company either personally or by sTerminationing it by courier, post, fax or email to him to his registered address, or (if he has no registered address) to the address, if any, supplied by him to the Company for the giving of notices to him. Any notice shall be deemed to be effected: 151.1 if delivered personally or sent by courier, by properly addressing and prepaying a letter containing the notice; and to have been effected, in the case of a notice of a meeting, when delivered; 151.2 if sent by post, by properly addressing, prepaying, and posting a letter containing the notice (by airmail if available) and to have been effected, in the case of a notice of a meeting, at the Termination of three days after it was posted; and 151.3 if sent by fax or email by properly addressing and sTerminationing such notice through the appropriate transmitting medium and to have been effected on the day the same is sent. 152. A notice may be given by the Company to the joint holders of a Share by giving the notice to the joint holder named first in the Register of Members in respect of the Share. 153. A notice may be given by the Company to the person entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a Member by sTerminationing it through the post in a prepaid letter addressed to them by name, or by the title of representatives of the deceased, or trustee of the bankrupt, or by any like description, at the address, if any, supplied for the purpose by the persons claiming to be so entitled, or (until such an address has been so supplied) by giving the notice in any manner in which the same might have been given if the death or bankruptcy had not occurred. 154. Notice of every general meeting shall be given in any manner hereinbefore authorised to: 154.1 every Member entitled to vote except those Members entitled to vote who (having no registered address) have not supplied to the Company an address for the giving of notices to them; and 154.2 every person entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a Member, who, but for his death or bankruptcy would be entitled to receive notice of the meeting. 155. No other persons shall be entitled to receive notices of general meeting. 35 WINDING UP Method of winding up 156. Subject to the rights attaching to any Shares, if the Company shall be wound up, the liquidator may, with the sanction of a Special Resolution and any other sanction required by the Law or these Articles, divide amongst the Members in kind the whole or any part of the assets of the Company (whether they shall consist of property of the same kind or not) and may for such purpose set such value as he deems fair upon any property to be divided as aforesaid and may determine how such division shall be carried out as between the Members or different classes of Members. The liquidator may, with the like sanction, vest the whole or any part of such assets in trustees upon such trusts for the benefit of the contributories as the liquidator, with the like sanction, shall think fit, but so that no Member shall be compelled to accept any asset upon which there is any liability. Distribution of assets 157. If the Company shall be wound up and the assets available for distribution amongst the Members as such shall be insufficient to repay the whole of the paid up capital, such assets shall be distributed so that, as nearly as may be, the losses shall be borne by the Members in proportion to the capital paid up, or which ought to have been paid up, at the commencement of the winding up, on the Shares held by them respectively. And if in a winding up the assets available for distribution amongst the Members shall be more than sufficient to repay the whole of the capital paid up at the commencement of the winding up, the excess shall be distributed amongst the Members in proportion to the capital paid up at the commencement of the winding up on the Shares held by them respectively. This Article is to be without prejudice to the rights of the holders of Shares issued upon special terms and conditions. Indemnification Indemnification and limitation of liability 158. Every Indemnified Person shall, in the absence of wilful neglect or default, be indemnified and held harmless out of the assets of the Company against all liabilities, loss, damage, cost or expense (including but not limited to liabilities under contract, tort and statute or any applicable foreign law or regulation and all reasonable legal and other costs and expenses on a full Indemnification basis properly payable) incurred or suffered by him by or by reason of any act done, conceived in or omitted in the conduct of the Company’s business or in the discharge of his duties and the Indemnification contained in this Article shall extTermination to any Indemnified Person acting in any office or trust in the reasonable belief that he has been appointed or elected to such office or trust notwithstanding any defect in such appointment or election. 36 159. No Indemnified Person shall be liable to the Company for acts, defaults or omissions of any other Indemnified Person. Indemnification and reimbursement 160. Every Indemnified Person shall be indemnified out of the funds of the Company against all liabilities incurred by him by or by reason of any act done, conceived in or omitted in the conduct of the Company’s business or in the discharge of his duties in defTerminationing any proceedings, whether civil or criminal, in which judgment is given in his favour, or in which he is acquitted, or in connection with any application in which relief from liability is granted to him by the court. 161. To the extent that any Indemnified Person is entitled to claim an Indemnification pursuant to these Articles in respect of amounts paid or discharged by him, the relative Indemnification shall take effect as an obligation of the Company to reimburse the person making such payment or effecting such discharge. Wilful neglect or default 162. Each Member and the Company agree to waive any claim or right of action he or it may at any time have, whether individually or by or in the right of the Company, against any Indemnified Person on account of any act or omission of such Indemnified Person in the performance of his duties for the Company; provided however, that such waiver shall not apply to any claims or rights of action arising out of the wilful neglect or default of such Indemnified Person or to recover any gain, personal profit or advantage to which such Indemnified Person is not legally entitled. Advance of legal fees 163. Expenses incurred in defTerminationing any civil or criminal action or proceeding for which indemnification is required pursuant to these Articles shall be paid by the Company in advance of the final disposition of such action or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnified Person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that the Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified pursuant to these Articles. Each Member of the Company shall be deemed to have acknowledged and agreed that the advances of funds may be made by the Company as aforesaid, and when made by the Company under this Article are made to meet expTerminationitures incurred for the purpose of enabling such Indemnified Person to properly perform his or her duties to the Company. 37 CONTINUATION 164. The Company shall have the power, subject to the provisions of the Law and with the approval of a Special Resolution, to continue as a body incorporated under the laws of any jurisdiction outside of the Cayman Islands and to be de-registered in the Cayman Islands. AMTerminationMENT OF MEMORANDUM AND ARTICLES Subject to the provisions of the Law, the Company may from time to time by Special Resolution alter or amTermination the Memorandum or these Articles in whole or in part provided that no such amTerminationment shall affect the special rights attaching to any class of Shares without the consent or sanction provided for in these Articles. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Memorandum or in these Articles or in Law, for so long as HLNG is a Member, the Company shall not alter or amTermination the Memorandum or these Articles in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of HLNG 38 SCHEDULE A INSURANCE POLICIES Hull & Material Adverse Effecthinery insurance: All insurances carried, or to be carried, by the owner of the Vessel are placed as part of Höegh LNG’s fleet placements in the international insurance markets.

If the Directors decline to register a Assignment of Shares they shall sTermination notice of the refusal to the Assignmentee within one month after the date on which the Assignment was lodged with the Company. 20. The Directors may also suspTermination the registration of the Assignments at such times and for such periods as the Directors may from time to time determine. TRANSMISSION OF SHARES Transmission of Shares 21. If a Member dies, the survivor or survivors (where he was a joint holder), and the legal personal representative (where he was sole holder), shall be the only person recognised by the Company as having any title to the Share. The estate of a deceased Member is not thereby released from any liability in respect of any Share held by him, whether solely or jointly. For the purpose of this Article, legal personal representative means the person to whom probate or letters of administration has or have been granted in the Cayman Islands or, if there is no such person, such other person as the Directors may in their absolute discretion determine to be the person recognised by the Company for the purpose of this Article. Election by persons entitled on transmission 22. Any person becoming entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a Member or otherwise by operation of Governing Law may elect, upon such evidence being produced as may be required by the Directors as to his entitlement, either be registered himself as a Member in respect of the Share or, instead of being registered himself, to make such Assignment of the Share as the deceased or bankrupt Member could have made. 7 Manner of election 23. If the person so becoming entitled elects to be registered himself, he shall deliver or sTermination to the Company a notice in writing signed by him stating that he so elects. If he shall elect to Assignment the Shares, he shall signify his election by signing an instrument of Assignment of such Shares in favour of his Assignmentee. All the limitations, restrictions and provisions of these Articles relating to the right to Assignment and the registration of Assignments of Shares shall be applicable to any such notice or instrument of Assignment as aforesaid as if the death of the Member or other event giving rise to the transmission had not occurred and the notice or instrument of Assignment was an instrument of Assignment signed by such Member. Rights of persons entitled on transmission 24. A person becoming entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of the Member (or otherwise by operation of Governing Law), upon such evidence being produced as may be required by the Directors as to his entitlement, shall be entitled to the same dividTerminations and other monies payable in respect of the Share as he would be entitled if he were the holder of such Share. However, he shall not be entitled, until he becomes registered as the holder of such Share, to receive notices of or to attTermination or vote at general meetings of the Company or (except as aforesaid) to exercise any other rights or privileges of a Member. The Directors may at any time give notice requiring such person to elect either to be registered himself or to Assignment the Share and, if the notice is not complied with within sixty days, the Directors may thereafter withhold payment of all dividTerminations and other monies payable in respect of the Shares until the requirements of the notice have been complied with. REDEMPTION AND PURCHASE OF SHARES 25. Subject to the provisions of the Law and the Memorandum, the Company may: 25.1 purchase its own Shares (including any redeemable Shares) in such manner and on such terms as the Directors may agree with the relevant Member unless following such purchase there would no longer be any issued Shares and may make payment for such purchase or for any redemption of Shares in any manner authorised by the Law, including out of capital; and 25.2 reduce its share capital and any capital redemption reserve fund in any manner whatsoever. 8 VARIATION OF SHARE RIGHTS Variation of class rights 26. If at any time the share capital is divided into different classes of Shares, all or any of the special rights attached to any class of Shares (unless otherwise provided by the terms of issue of the Shares of that class) may be varied or abrogated with the consent in writing of the holders of not less than two thirds of the issued Shares of that class or with the sanction of a resolution passed by the holders of not less than two thirds of the issued Shares of that class as may be present in person or by proxy at a separate general meeting of the holders of the Shares of that class. To any such separate general meeting, all of the provisions of these Articles relating to general meetings shall mutatis mutandis apply, but so that the necessary quorum shall be any one or more persons holding or representing by proxy not less than one third of the issued Shares of the class and that any holder of Shares of the relevant class present in person or by proxy may demand a poll. Treatment of classes 27. For the purpose of a separate class meeting, the Directors may treat two or more of all classes of Shares as forming one class if they consider that such class of Shares would be affected in the same way by the proposals under consideration. Effect of Share issue on class rights 28. The rights conferred upon the holders of any Shares shall not, unless otherwise expressly provided in the rights attaching to such Shares, be deemed to be altered by the creation or issue of further Shares ranking pari passu therewith. NON-RECOGNITION OF TRUSTS 29. Except as required by the Law or these Articles, or under an order of a court of competent jurisdiction, the Company shall not be bound by or compelled to recognise in any way, even when notice thereof is given to it, any equitable, contingent, future or partial interest in any Share, or any other rights in respect of any Share other than an absolute right to the entirety thereof in the registered holder. 9 LIEN Lien generally 30. The Company shall have a first and paramount lien on every Share (not being a fully paid Share) for all moneys (whether presently payable or not) called or payable at a date fixed by or in accordance with the terms of issue of such Share in respect of that Share, and the Company shall also have a first and paramount lien on every Share (other than a fully paid up Share) standing registered in the name of a Member, whether singly or jointly with any other person for all debts and liabilities of a Member or his estate to the Company, whether the same shall have been incurred before or after notice to the Company of any interest of any person other than such Member, and whether the time for the payment or discharge of the same shall have actually arrived or not, and notwithstanding that the same are joint debts or liabilities of such Member or his estate and any other person, whether a Member or not. The Directors may at any time, either generally or in any particular case, waive any lien that has arisen or declare any Share to be wholly or in part exempt from the provisions of this Article. The Company's lien, if any, on a Share shall extTermination to all dividTerminations payable thereon. Enforcement 31. The Company may sell, in such manner as the Directors think fit, any Share on which the Company has a lien, provided a sum in respect of which the lien exists is presently payable, and is not paid within fourteen days after a notice in writing has been given to the registered holder  for the time being of the Share, demanding payment of the sum presently payable and giving notice of the intention to sell in default of such payment. Completion of sale 32. For giving effect to any such sale, the Directors may authorise any person to Assignment the Share sold to the purchaser thereof. The purchaser shall be registered as the holder of the Share comprised in any such Assignment and he shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money, nor shall his title to the Share be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings relating to the sale. Application of proceeds 33. The net proceeds of such sale shall be applied in payment or discharge of the debt or liability in respect of which the lien exists and as is presently payable, and any balance shall (subject to a like lien for debts or liabilities not presently payable as existed upon the Shares prior to the sale) be paid to the person who was the registered holder of the Share immediately before such sale. CALLS ON SHARES Calls on Shares generally 34. The Directors may from time to time make calls upon the Members in respect of any moneys unpaid on their Shares (whether in respect of the par value of the Shares or premium or otherwise and not, by the terms of issue thereof, made payable at a future date fixed by or in accordance with such terms of issue); and each Member shall (subject to the Company serving upon him at least 14 days’ notice specifying the time or times and place of payment) pay to the Company at the time or times and place so specified the amount called on his Shares. A call may be revoked or postponed by the Directors wholly or in part as the Directors may determine. A call shall be deemed to have been made at the time when the resolution of the Directors authorising the call was passed. 10 Payment 35. Payment of a call may be made by instalments on the direction of the Directors. 36. If a sum called in respect of a Share is not paid before or on the day appointed for payment thereof, the person from whom the sum is due shall pay interest on the sum from the day payment is due to the time of the actual payment at such rate as the Directors may determine, but the Directors may waive payment of such interest wholly or in part. 37. Any sum payable in respect of a Share on issue or allotment or at any fixed date, whether in respect of the par value of the Share or premium or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a call and if it is not paid all the relevant provisions as to payment of interest, forfeiture or otherwise of these Articles shall apply as if such sum had become due and payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified. 38. The Directors may issue Shares with different terms as to the amount and times of payment of calls. Liability of joint holders 39. The joint holders of a Share shall be jointly and severally liable to pay calls in respect thereof. Interest 40. The Directors may, if they think fit, receive from any Member willing to advance the same, all or any part of the moneys uncalled and unpaid upon any Shares held by him; and may (until the amount would otherwise become payable) pay interest at such rate (not exceeding six per cent without the sanction of the Company in general meeting) as may be agreed upon between the Member paying the sum in advance and the Directors. FORFEITURE OF SHARES Notice 41. If a Member fails to pay any call or instalment of a call by the date it becomes due and payable, the Directors may, at any time thereafter while such call or instalment remains unpaid, give notice to the Member requiring payment of the unpaid portion of the call or instalment, together with any accrued interest and expenses incurred by the Company by reason of such non-payment. 11 42. The notice shall specify where and by what date (not being less than the Termination of 14 days’ from the date of the notice) payment is to be made and shall state that if it is not complied with the Shares in respect of which the call was made will be liable to be forfeited. The Directors may accept the surrTerminationer of any Share liable to be forfeited hereunder and, in such case, references to these Articles to forfeiture shall include surrTerminationer. Forfeiture for non-compliance 43. If such notice is not complied with, any Share in respect of which the notice was given may thereafter, before the payment of all calls or instalments and interest due in respect thereof has been made, be forfeited by a resolution of the Directors. Such forfeiture shall include all dividTerminations declared, other distributions or other monies payable in respect of the forfeited Shares and not paid before the forfeiture. Forfeited Shares 44. A forfeited Share may be sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed of upon such terms and in such manner as the Directors shall think fit, and at any time before a sale, re-allotment or disposition, the forfeiture may be cancelled on such terms as the Directors think fit. Continued liability for forfeited Member 45. A person whose Shares have been forfeited shall cease to be a Member in respect of the forfeited Shares, but shall remain liable to pay to the Company all moneys which at the date of forfeiture were presently payable by him in respect of the Shares together with interest at such rate as the Directors may determine from the date of forfeiture until payment, but his liability shall cease if and when the Company receives payment in full of all amounts due in respect of the Shares. The Company may enforce payment without being under any obligation to make any allowance for the value of the Shares forfeited. Evidence of forfeiture 46. An affidavit in writing by a Director or Secretary of the Company that a Share has been duly forfeited on a specified date, shall be conclusive evidence of the facts stated in it as against all persons claiming to be entitled to the Share. The Company may receive the consideration, if any, given for the Share on any sale, re-allotment or disposition thereof and may authorise some person to execute a Assignment of the Share in favour of the person to whom the Share is sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed of, and he shall thereupon be registered as the holder of the Share, and shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money (if any) nor shall his title to the Share be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings in reference to the forfeiture, sale, re-allotment or disposition of the Share. 12 47. The provisions of these Articles as to forfeiture shall apply in the case of non-payment of any sum which, by the terms of issue of a Share, becomes payable at a fixed time, whether on account of the par value of the Share, or by way of premium or otherwise, as if the same had been made payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified to the Member. INCREASE OF CAPITAL 48. The Company may from time to time by Ordinary Resolution increase its share capital by such sum, to be divided into new Shares of such par value, and with such rights, priorities and privileges attached thereto as the resolution shall prescribe. 49. Subject to any directions given by the Company in a general meeting, all new Shares shall be at the disposal of the Directors in accordance with these Articles. 50. The new Shares shall be subject to the same provisions of these Articles with reference to the payment of calls, lien, forfeiture, Assignment, transmission and otherwise, as the Shares in the original share capital. ALTERATION OF CAPITAL 51. The Company may from time to time by Ordinary Resolution: 51.1 consolidate and divide all or any of its share capital into Shares of larger par value than its existing Shares; 51.2 sub divide its existing Shares, or any of them, into Shares of smaller par value than is fixed by the Memorandum, subject nevertheless to the provisions of section 13 of the Law; 51.3 cancel any Shares which, at the date of the passing of the resolution, have not been taken or agreed to be taken by any person; and 51.4 convert all or any paid up Shares into stock, and reconvert all or any stock into paid up Shares of any denomination. 52. The Company may from time to time by Special Resolution: 52.1 divide its Shares into several classes and attach to such classes any preferential, deferred, or special rights or restrictions in accordance with these Articles; 52.2 change the currency denomination of its share capital; 13 52.3 reduce its share capital and any capital redemption reserve fund in any manner whatsoever; and 52.4 merge or consolidate with any one or more constituent companies (as defined in the Law). GENERAL MEETINGS Convening a meeting 53. The Directors may, whenever they think fit, convene an extraordinary general meeting. If at any time there are not sufficient Directors capable of acting to form a quorum, any Director, or any one or more Members holding in the aggregate not less than one third of the total issued share capital of the Company entitled to vote, may convene an extraordinary general meeting in the same manner as nearly as possible as that in which meetings may be convened by the Directors. Members’ requisition 54. The Directors shall, upon the requisition in writing of one or more Members holding in the aggregate not less than one tenth of such paid up capital of the Company as at the date of the requisition carries the right of voting at general meetings, convene an extraordinary general meeting. Any such requisition shall express the object of the meeting proposed to be called, and must be signed by the requisitionists and deposited at the Registered Office, and may consist of several documents in like form, each signed by one or more requisitionists. 55. If there are no Directors as at the date of the deposit of the Members’ requisition or if the Directors do not convene a general meeting within 21 days from the date of the deposit, the requisitionists or any or any of them or any other Member or Members holding in the aggregate not less than one tenth of such paid up capital of the Company as at the date of the requisition, may convene an extraordinary general meeting. A general meeting convened by requisitionists shall be convened in the same manner as nearly as possible as that in which general meetings are to be convened by the Directors. NOTICE OF GENERAL MEETINGS Length and form of notice 56. At least five clear days’ notice shall be given of any general meeting. Every notice shall specify the place, the day and the time of meeting and, in the case of special business, the general nature of the business to be conducted at the general meeting, and shall be given in the manner provided in these Articles or in such other manner (if any) as may be prescribed by the Company, to such persons as are entitled to receive such notices from the Company. A general meeting may be convened by such shorter notice, or without notice, by a majority in number of the Members having the right to attTermination and vote at the meeting, being a majority together holding not less than ninety-five percent in nominal value of the Shares giving that right. 14 Omission or non-receipt 57. The accidental omission to give notice of a meeting to, or the non-receipt of a notice of a meeting by, any Member entitled to receive notice shall not invalidate the proceedings at any meeting. PROCEEDINGS AT GENERAL MEETINGS 58. All business shall be deemed special that is transacted at an extraordinary general meeting. Quorum 59. No business shall be transacted at any general meeting unless a quorum of Members is present at the time that the meeting proceeds to business, but the absence of a quorum shall not preclude the appointment, choice or election of a chairman, which shall not be treated as part of the business of the Meeting. Save as herein otherwise provided, one or more Members holding in the aggregate not less than one third of the total issued share capital of the Company present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall be a quorum. Adjournment for lack of quorum 60. If within five minutes (or such longer time as the chairman of the meeting may determine to wait) after the time appointed for the meeting, a quorum is not present, the meeting, if convened upon the requisition of Members, shall be dissolved. In any other case, it shall stand adjourned to the same day in the next week, at the same time and place, and if at the adjourned meeting a quorum is not present within half an hour from the time appointed for the meeting, the Members present shall be a quorum. Meeting by telephone or other facilities 61. A meeting of the Members may be held by telephone, electronic or other communication facilities (including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, by telephone or video conferencing) by which all persons participating in the meeting can communicate with each other simultaneously and instantaneously, and participation in such a general meeting shall constitute presence in person at such meeting. 62. Any Director shall be entitled to attTermination and speak at any general meeting of the Company. 15 Appointment of chairman 63. The chairman (if any) of the Board of Directors shall preside as chairman at every general meeting of the Company. If there is no such chairman, or if at any meeting he is not present within five minutes after the time appointed for holding the meeting or is unwilling to act as chairman, the Directors present shall choose one of their number to act or, if only one Director is present, he shall preside as chairman if willing to act. If no Director is present, or if each of the Directors present declines to take the chair, the Members present and entitled to vote shall elect one of their number to be chairman. Adjournment of meeting 64. The chairman may, with the consent of a meeting at which a quorum is present (and shall if so directed by the meeting) adjourn the meeting from time to time and from place to place, but no business shall be transacted at any adjourned meeting other than the business left unfinished at the meeting from which the adjournment took place. When a meeting is adjourned for ten days or more, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given as in the case of an original meeting. Save as aforesaid, it shall not be necessary to give any notice of an adjournment or of the business to be transacted at an adjourned meeting. VOTING Ordinary Resolution Save where a Special Resolution or other greater majority is required by the Law or these Articles, any question proposed for consideration at any general meeting shall be decided by an Ordinary Resolution. Voting on a show of hands 65. At any general meeting, a resolution put to the vote of the meeting shall be decided on a show of hands, unless before or on the declaration of the result of the show of hands, or on the withdrawal of any other demand for a poll. Demand for poll 66. A poll is demanded by: 66.1 the chairman of the meeting; or 66.2 at least three Members present in person or by proxy; or 66.3 any Member or Members present in person or by proxy and holding collectively not less than one tenth of the total voting rights of all the Members having the right to vote at such meeting; or 16 66.4 a Member or Members present in person or by proxy holding Shares conferring the right to vote at such meeting, being Shares on which an aggregate sum has been paid up equal to not less than one tenth of the total sum paid up on all such Shares conferring such right. 67. Unless a poll is duly demanded and the demand is not withdrawn, a declaration by the chairman that a resolution has, on a show of hands, been carried or carried unanimously, or by a particular majority, or lost and an entry to that effect in the minutes of the proceedings of the Company shall be conclusive evidence of that fact, without proof of the number or proportion of the votes recorded in favour of, or against, that resolution. The demand for a poll may be withdrawn by the person or any persons making it at any time prior to the declaration of the result of the poll. 68. If a poll is duly demanded, it shall be taken in such manner as the chairman directs, and the result of the poll shall be deemed to be the resolution of the meeting at which the poll was demanded. 69. In the case of an equality of votes at a general meeting, whether on a show of hands or on a poll, the chairman of the meeting at which the show of hands takes place or at which the poll is demanded, shall not be entitled to a second or casting vote and the resolution shall fail. 70. A poll demanded on the election of a chairman or on a question of adjournment shall be taken forthwith. A poll demanded on any other question shall be taken in such manner and either forthwith or at such time later in the meeting as the chairman of the meeting shall direct. 71. The demand for a poll shall not prevent the continuance of a meeting for the transaction of any business other than the question on which the poll has been demanded and it may be withdrawn at any time before the close of the meeting or the taking of the poll, whichever is the earlier. Voting on a poll 72. On a poll votes may be cast either personally or by proxy. 73. A person entitled to more than one vote on a poll need not use all his votes or cast all the votes he uses in the same way. 74. On a show of hands, every Member present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall have one vote. On a poll, every Member present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall have one vote for each Share of which he is the registered holder. 17 75. In the case of joint holders of a Share, the vote of the senior who tTerminationers a vote, whether in person or by proxy, shall be accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint holders; and for this purpose seniority shall be determined by the order in which the names stand in the Register of Members in respect of the joint holding. 76. A Member of unsound mind, or, in respect of whom an order has been made by any court having jurisdiction in lunacy, may vote, whether on a show of hands or on a poll, by his receiver, committee, curator bonis or other person of similar nature appointed by such court, and any such receiver, committee, curator bonis or other person may vote by proxy and may otherwise act and be treated as such Member for the purpose of the general meetings. 77. No Member, unless the Directors otherwise determine, shall be entitled to vote at any general meeting, unless all calls or other sums presently payable by him in respect of Shares in the Company have been paid. 78. No objection shall be raised as to the qualification of any voter or as to whether any votes have been properly counted except at the general meeting or adjourned general meeting at which the vote objected to is given or tTerminationered and every vote not disallowed at the meeting shall be valid. Any objection made in due time and in accordance with these Articles shall be referred to the chairman whose decision shall be final and conclusive. Shareholder Restricted Matters 78A. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Memorandum or in these Articles or in the Law, for so long as HLNG is a Member, the Company shall not consent to or approve, and shall not permit any of Höegh LNG Colombia S.A.S. or Höegh LNG FSRU IV to consent to or approve, any of the following actions without the prior written consent of HLNG: 78A.1 any merger or consolidation involving any of the Company, Höegh LNG Colombia S.A.S. or Höegh LNG FSRU IV, or any of their respective subsidiaries; or 78A.2 any sale, exchange or Assignment of all or substantially all of the assets of any of the Company, Höegh LNG Colombia S.A.S. or Höegh LNG FSRU IV, or any of their respective subsidiaries; 78A.3 dissolution or liquidation of any of the Company, Höegh LNG Colombia S.A.S. or Höegh LNG FSRU IVor any of their respective subsidiaries; or 78A.4 creating or causing to exist any consensual restriction on the ability of any of the Company, Höegh LNG Colombia S.A.S. or Höegh LNG FSRU IV, or any of their respective subsidiaries, to make distributions, pay any indebtedness, make loans or advanes or Assignment assets to their respective owners, members or shareholders, or their respective subsidiaries; or 18 78A.5 settling or compromising any claim, dispute or Dispute Resolution directly against, or otherwise relating to indemnification by any of the Company, Höegh LNG Colombia S.A.S. or Höegh LNG FSRU IV, or any of their respective subsidiaries, of any of the directors or officers of HMLP, Höegh LNG Holdings Ltd. or HLNG, or their respective subsidiaries; or 78A.6 issuing any additional ownership interests in any of the Company, Höegh LNG Colombia S.A.S. or Höegh LNG FSRU IV[, or any of their respective subsidiaries]; or 78A.7 amTerminationing, supplementing or otherwise modifying, in whole or in part, the Memorandum or these Articles.

Any corporation which is a Member of the Company may by resolution of its directors or other governing body authorise such person as it thinks fit to act as its representative at any meeting of the Company or of any class of Members of the Company, and the person so authorised shall be entitled to exercise the same powers on behalf of the corporation which he represents as that corporation could exercise if it were an individual Member of the Company.

In default of any of the provisions in these Articles to deposit any instrument of proxy or authorisation at the Registered Office of the Company or at such other place as is specified for that purpose in the notice convening the meeting, the instrument of proxy or authorisation shall not be treated as valid provided that the chairman of the meeting may in his discretion accept an instrument of proxy or authorisation sent by email or fax upon receipt of email or fax confirmation that the signed original thereof has been sent. 20 Standing Proxy 86. The operation of a standing proxy or authorisation shall be suspTerminationed at any general meeting or adjournment thereof at which the Member is present in person or by specially appointed proxy.

The instrument appointing a proxy shall be deemed to confer authority to demand or join in demanding a poll, to speak at the meeting and to vote on any amTerminationment of a written resolution or amTerminationment of a resolution put to the meeting for which it is given as the proxy thinks fit. The instrument of proxy or authorisation shall, unless the contrary is stated therein, be valid as well for any adjournment of the meeting as for the meeting to which it relates.

Authority to bind Company 101. No document or deed otherwise duly executed and delivered by or on behalf of the Company shall be regarded as invalid merely because at the date of delivery of the deed or document, the Director, Secretary or other officer or person who shall have executed the same and/or affixed the Seal (if any) thereto as the case may be for and on behalf of the Company shall have ceased to hold such office or to hold such authority on behalf of the Company.

Any person so appointed shall receive such remuneration (if any) (whether by way of salary, commission, participation in profits or otherwise) as the Directors may determine, and either in addition to or in lieu of his remuneration as a Director. 24 Sole Director 103. Notwithstanding any provision in these Articles to the contrary, a sole Director shall be entitled to exercise all of the powers and functions of the Directors which may be imposed on them by Law or by these Articles.

Vacancies 107. The continuing Directors may act notwithstanding any vacancy in their body, but, if and so long as their number is reduced below the number fixed by or pursuant to these Articles as the necessary quorum of Directors, the continuing Directors may act for the purpose of increasing the number of Directors to that number, or of summoning a general meeting of the Company, but for no other purpose. 25 Chairman 108. The Directors may elect a chairman of their meetings and determine the period for which he is to hold office; but if no such chairman is elected, or if at any meeting the chairman is not present within five minutes after the time appointed for holding the same, the Directors present may choose one of their number to be chairman of the meeting.

Meeting by telephone or other facilities 110. To the extent permitted by law, a meeting of the Directors or a committee appointed by the Directors may be held by means of such telephone, electronic or other communication facilities (including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, by telephone or by video conferencing) as permit all persons participating in the meeting to communicate with each other simultaneously and instantaneously and participation in such a meeting shall constitute presence in person at such meeting. Such a meeting shall be deemed to take place where the largest group of those Directors participating in the meeting is physically assembled, or, if there is no such group, where the chairman of the meeting then is. Validity of acts in spite of defect 111. All acts done by any meeting of the Directors or of a committee of Directors, or by any person acting as a Director shall, notwithstanding that it be afterwards discovered that there was some defect in the appointment of any such Director or person acting as aforesaid, or that they or any of them were disqualified, be as valid as if every such person had been duly appointed and was qualified to be a Director. Minutes 112. The Directors shall cause minutes to be made and records kept for the purpose of recording: 26 112.1 all appointments of officers made by the Directors; 112.2 the names of the Directors and other persons present at each meeting of the Directors and of any committee of the Directors; and 112.3 all resolutions and proceedings at all meetings of the Members of the Company or any class of Members and of the Directors and of committees of Directors; and the chairman of all such meetings or of any meeting confirming the minutes thereof shall sign the same. DIRECTORS’ INTERESTS 113. A Director may hold any other office or place of profit with the Company (except that of Auditor) in conjunction with his office of Director for such period and upon such terms as to remuneration and otherwise as the Directors may determine. 114. A Director or officer may act by himself or his firm in a professional capacity for the Company (otherwise than as Auditor), and he or his firm shall be entitled to remuneration for professional services as if he were not a Director or officer. 115. No Director or officer shall be disqualified from his office or prevented by such office from holding any office or place of profit under the Company or under any company in which the Company shall be a Member or have any interest, or from contracting with the Company, either as vTerminationor, purchaser or otherwise, nor shall any such contract or any contract or transaction entered into by or on behalf of the Company in which any Director or officer shall be in any way interested be or be liable to be avoided nor shall any Director or officer so contracting, dealing or being so interested be liable to account to the Company for any profit realised by any such contract or transaction by reason of such Director holding office or of the fiduciary relation thereby established. Disclosure and nature of interest 116. A Director (or his alternate Director in his absence) shall be at liberty to vote in respect of any contract or transaction in which he is interested provided that the nature of the interest of the Director in any such contract or transaction shall be disclosed by him at or prior to its consideration and any vote thereon. 117.

Directors may from time to time and at any time by power of attorney or otherwise appoint any company, firm or person or fluctuating body of persons, whether nominated directly or indirectly by the Directors, to be the attorney or attorneys of the Company for such purposes and with such powers, authorities and discretions (not exceeding those vested in or exercisable by the Directors under these Articles) and for such period and subject to such conditions as they may think fit, and any such power of attorney may contain such provisions for the protection and convenience of persons dealing with any such attorney and of such attorney as the Directors may think fit and may also authorise any such attorney to delegate all or any of the powers, authorities and discretions vested in him. 119. The Directors may delegate any of the powers exercisable by them to a Managing Director , Director or any other person or persons acting individually or jointly as they may from time to time by resolution appoint upon such terms and conditions and with such restrictions as they may think fit, and may from time to time by resolution revoke, withdraw, alter or vary all or any such powers. Alternate Directors 120. Any Director may by writing appoint any other Director, or other person willing to act, to be his alternate and remove his alternate so appointed by him. Such appointment or removal shall be by notice to the Registered Office signed by the Director making or revoking the appointment or in any other manner approved by the Directors, and shall be effective on the date the notice is served and the alternate shall be notified of such appointment or revocation. Subject to the removal by the appointing Director, the alternate shall continue in office until the date on which his appointor ceases to be a Director. An alternate may also be a Director in his own right and may act as alternate to more than one Director. 121. An alternate shall be entitled to receive notice of all meetings of the Directors, attTermination, be counted in the quorum, vote and act in such appointor’s place at every such meeting at which the appointing Director is not personally present, and generally to perform all the functions of his appointor as a Director in his absence. 122. These Articles (except as regards powers to appoint an alternate and remuneration) apply equally to the alternate as though he were the Director in his own right. 123. An alternate Director shall be deemed for all purposes to be a Director and shall alone be responsible for his own acts and defaults and shall not be deemed to be the agent of the Director appointing him. The signature of an alternate to any resolution in writing of the Director or a committee there shall, unless the terms of the appointment provides to the contrary, be as effective as the signature of the Director or Directors to whom he is alternate. 28 Committees of Directors 124. The Directors may delegate any of their powers to committees consisting of such member or members of their body as they think fit; any committee so formed shall, in the exercise of the powers so delegated, conform to any regulations that may be imposed on it by the Directors. 125. A committee may elect a chairman of its meetings; if no such chairman is elected, or if at any meeting the chairman is not present within five minutes after the time appointed for holding the same, the members present may choose one of their number to be chairman of the meeting. 126. A committee may meet and adjourn as it thinks proper. Questions arising at any meeting shall be determined by a majority of votes of the members present and in case of an equality of votes the chairman shall not have a second or casting vote and the motion shall be deemed to have been lost. Officers 127. The Directors may appoint a Secretary and such other officers as they may from time to time consider necessary upon such terms as to duration of office, remuneration and otherwise as they may think fit. Such Secretary or other officers need not be Directors and in the case of the other officers may be ascribed such titles as the Directors may decide and the Directors may revoke or terminate any such election or appointment. Any such revocation or termination shall be without prejudice to any claim for any damages that such officer may have against the Company or the Company may have against such officer for any breach of any contract of service between him and the Company which may be involved in such revocation or termination. Save as provided in the Law or these Articles, the powers and duties of the officers of the Company shall be such (if any) as are determined from time to time by the Directors. DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION Remuneration 128. The remuneration to be paid to the Directors, if any, shall be determined by the Company in general meeting or, in the absence of such a determination, by the Directors. Expenses 129. Each Director shall also be entitled to be paid his reasonable travelling, hotel and other expenses properly incurred by him in connection with his attTerminationance at meetings of the Directors, committees of the Directors or general meetings of the Company, or otherwise in connection with the business of the Company, or to receive a fixed allowance in respect thereof as may be determined by the Directors, or a combination partly of one such method and partly the other. 29 Additional remuneration 130. The Directors may by resolution approve additional remuneration to any Director for services which in the opinion of the Directors go beyond the ordinary duties of a Director, and such extra remuneration shall be in addition to any remuneration provided for, by or pursuant to any other Article. SEALS AND DEEDS Use of Seal 131. The Directors may determine that the Company shall have a Seal, and if they so determine, shall provide for the safe custody of the Seal. The Seal shall only be used by the authority of the Directors and in the presence of a Director or the Secretary or such other person as the Directors may by resolution appoint for this purpose, and every instrument to which the Seal affixed shall be signed by the relevant person. Notwithstanding the above, annual returns and notices filed under the Law may be executed either as a deed or under Seal and in either case without the need for the authority of a resolution of the Directors. 30 Duplicate Seal 132. The Company may maintain in any place or places outside the Cayman Islands a facsimile of any Seal and such facsimile seal shall be affixed in the same way as if it were the Seal. Execution of deeds 133. In accordance with the Law, the Company may execute any deed or other instrument (which would otherwise be required to be executed under Seal) by the signature of such deed or instrument as a deed by a Director or by the Secretary of the Company or by such other person as the Directors may appoint or by any other person or attorney on behalf of the Company appointed by a deed or other instrument executed as a deed by a Director or the Secretary or such other person as aforesaid. DIVIDTerminationS Payment of DividTerminations 134. The Directors may from time to time declare dividTerminations to be paid to the Members according to their rights and interests, including such interim dividTerminations as appear to the Directors to be justified by the position of the Company. The Directors may also pay any fixed cash dividTermination which is payable on any Shares of the Company half yearly or on such other dates, whenever the position of the Company, in the opinion of the Directors, justifies such payment. 135. No dividTermination shall be paid otherwise than out of profits or out of monies otherwise available for dividTermination in accordance with the Law. Calculation of DividTerminations 136. Subject to the rights of Members, if any, entitled to Shares with special rights as to dividTerminations, all dividTerminations shall be declared and paid according to the amount paid up on the Shares in respect of which the dividTermination is paid and any dividTermination on any class of Shares not fully paid shall be declared and paid according to the amounts paid on the Shares of that class, but if and so long as nothing is paid up on any of the Shares in the Company, dividTerminations may be declared and paid according to the number of Shares. No amount paid on a Share in advance of calls shall, while carrying interest, be treated for the purposes of this Article as paid on the Share. DividTerminations may be apportioned and paid pro rata according to the amounts paid-up on the Shares during any portion or portions of the period in respect of which the dividTermination is paid. 31 Deductions 137. The Directors may deduct from any dividTermination, distribution or other monies payable to a Member by the Company on or in respect of any Shares all sums of money (if any) presently payable by him to the Company on account of calls or otherwise in respect of Shares of the Company. Joint Holders 138. If several persons are registered as joint holders of any Share, any of them may give effectual receipts for any dividTermination or other money payable on or in respect of the Share. Payment method 139. Any dividTermination may be paid by cheque or warrant sent through the post to the address of the Member or person entitled thereto in the Register of Members or, in the case of joint holders addressed to the holder whose name stands first in the Register of Members in respect of the Shares at his registered address as appearing on the Register of Members or to such person and such address as the Member or person entitled or such joint holders as the case may be may direct in writing. Every such cheque or warrant shall, unless the holder or joint holders may in writing direct, be made payable to the order of the person to whom it is sent or to the order of the holder or, in the case of joint holders, to the order of the holder whose name stands first in the Register of Members in respect of such Shares, and shall be sent at his or their risk and payment of the cheque or warrant by the bank on which it is drawn shall constitute a good discharge to the Company. Any one of two or more joint holders may give effectual receipts for any dividTerminations, distributions or other monies payable or property distributable in respect of the Shares held by such joint holders. Satisfaction by distribution of specific assets 140. The Directors may declare that any dividTermination or distribution is paid wholly or partly by the distribution of specific assets and, in particular, of paid up shares, debentures or debenture stock of any other company or in any one or more of such ways, and where any difficulty arises in regard to such dividTermination or distribution, the Directors may settle the same as they think expedient, and in particular may issue fractional Shares or ignore fractions altogether and may fix the value for dividTermination or distribution of such specific assets or any part thereof and may determine that cash payments shall be made to any Members upon the basis of the value so fixed in order to secure equality of distribution, and may vest any such specific assets in trustees as may seem expedient to the Directors. 32 No interest 141. No dividTermination or other distribution or other monies payable by the Company on or in respect of any Share shall bear interest against the Company. Unclaimed dividTerminations 142. All unclaimed dividTerminations or distributions may be invested or otherwise made use of by the Directors for the benefit of the Company until claimed. Any dividTermination or distribution unclaimed by a Member six years after the dividTermination or distribution payment date shall be forfeited and revert to the Company. RESERVES 143. The Directors may, before declaring any dividTermination or distribution, set aside such sums as they think proper as a reserve or reserves which shall, at the discretion of the Directors, be applicable for meeting contingencies, or for equalising dividTerminations, or for any other purpose of the Company, and pTerminationing such application may, in their discretion, be employed in the business of the Company or be invested in such manner as the Directors may from time to time think fit. The Directors may also without placing the same to reserve carry forward any sums which they think it prudent not to distribute. CAPITALISATION OF PROFITS Capitalisation 144. The Directors may capitalise any sum standing to the credit of any of the Company’s reserve accounts which are available for distribution (including its Share Premium Account and capital redemption reserve fund, subject to the Law) or any sum standing to the credit of the profit and loss account or otherwise available for distribution and to appropriate such sums to Members in the proportions in which such sum would have been divisible amongst them had the same been a distribution of profits by way of dividTermination and to apply such sum on their behalf in paying up in full unissued Shares for allotment and distribution credited as fully paid-up to and amongst them in the proportion aforesaid. Authorisation 145. Where any difficulty arises in regard to any distribution under the last preceding Article, the Directors may settle the same as they think expedient and, in particular, may authorise any person to sell and Assignment any fractions or may resolve that the distribution should be as nearly as may be practicable in the correct proportion but not exactly so or may ignore fractions altogether, and may determine that cash payments should be made to any Members in order to adjust the rights of all parties, as may seem expedient to the Directors. The Directors may appoint any person to sign on behalf of the persons entitled to participate in the distribution any contract necessary or desirable for giving effect thereto and such appointment shall be effective and binding upon the Members. 33 SHARE PREMIUM ACCOUNT 146. The Directors shall in accordance with the Law establish a Share Premium Account and shall carry to the credit of such account from time to time a sum equal to the amount or value of the premium paid on the issue of any Share. 147. There shall be debited to any Share Premium Account on the redemption or purchase of a Share the difference between the nominal value of such Share and the redemption or purchase price provided always that at the discretion of the Directors such sum may be paid out of the profits of the Company or, if permitted by the Law, out of capital. ACCOUNTING RECORDS Books of account 148. The Directors shall cause to be kept accounting records sufficient to give a true and fair view of the state of the Company's affairs and to show and explain its transactions and otherwise in accordance with the Law. Inspection by Members 149. The accounting records shall be kept at the Registered Office or at such other place or places as the Directors think fit, and shall at all times be open to inspection by the Directors. No Member (who is not also a Director) shall have any right to inspect any accounting record or book or document of the Company except as conferred by law or authorised by the Directors or by the Members by Ordinary Resolution. Records and audit 150. From time to time the Company in general meeting may determine (or revoke, alter or amTermination any such determination) or, failing such determination, the Directors may determine (or revoke, alter or amTermination any such determination): 150.1 that the accounts of the Company be audited and the appointment of the Auditors; 150.2 that there be prepared and sent to each Member and other person entitled thereto a profit and loss account, a balance sheet, group accounts and/or reports for such period and on such terms as they may determine; and 150.3 that there be laid before the Company in general meeting a copy of every balance sheet together with a copy of the Auditor's report. 34 SERVICE OF NOTICES AND DOCUMENTS Form and delivery of notices 151. Notices or other documents or communications may be given to any Member by the Company either personally or by sTerminationing it by courier, post, fax or email to him to his registered address, or (if he has no registered address) to the address, if any, supplied by him to the Company for the giving of notices to him. Any notice shall be deemed to be effected: 151.1 if delivered personally or sent by courier, by properly addressing and prepaying a letter containing the notice; and to have been effected, in the case of a notice of a meeting, when delivered; 151.2 if sent by post, by properly addressing, prepaying, and posting a letter containing the notice (by airmail if available) and to have been effected, in the case of a notice of a meeting, at the Termination of three days after it was posted; and 151.3 if sent by fax or email by properly addressing and sTerminationing such notice through the appropriate transmitting medium and to have been effected on the day the same is sent. 152. A notice may be given by the Company to the joint holders of a Share by giving the notice to the joint holder named first in the Register of Members in respect of the Share. 153. A notice may be given by the Company to the person entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a Member by sTerminationing it through the post in a prepaid letter addressed to them by name, or by the title of representatives of the deceased, or trustee of the bankrupt, or by any like description, at the address, if any, supplied for the purpose by the persons claiming to be so entitled, or (until such an address has been so supplied) by giving the notice in any manner in which the same might have been given if the death or bankruptcy had not occurred. 154. Notice of every general meeting shall be given in any manner hereinbefore authorised to: 154.1 every Member entitled to vote except those Members entitled to vote who (having no registered address) have not supplied to the Company an address for the giving of notices to them; and 154.2 every person entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a Member, who, but for his death or bankruptcy would be entitled to receive notice of the meeting. 155. No other persons shall be entitled to receive notices of general meeting. 35 WINDING UP Method of winding up 156. Subject to the rights attaching to any Shares, if the Company shall be wound up, the liquidator may, with the sanction of a Special Resolution and any other sanction required by the Law or these Articles, divide amongst the Members in kind the whole or any part of the assets of the Company (whether they shall consist of property of the same kind or not) and may for such purpose set such value as he deems fair upon any property to be divided as aforesaid and may determine how such division shall be carried out as between the Members or different classes of Members. The liquidator may, with the like sanction, vest the whole or any part of such assets in trustees upon such trusts for the benefit of the contributories as the liquidator, with the like sanction, shall think fit, but so that no Member shall be compelled to accept any asset upon which there is any liability. Distribution of assets 157. If the Company shall be wound up and the assets available for distribution amongst the Members as such shall be insufficient to repay the whole of the paid up capital, such assets shall be distributed so that, as nearly as may be, the losses shall be borne by the Members in proportion to the capital paid up, or which ought to have been paid up, at the commencement of the winding up, on the Shares held by them respectively. And if in a winding up the assets available for distribution amongst the Members shall be more than sufficient to repay the whole of the capital paid up at the commencement of the winding up, the excess shall be distributed amongst the Members in proportion to the capital paid up at the commencement of the winding up on the Shares held by them respectively. This Article is to be without prejudice to the rights of the holders of Shares issued upon special terms and conditions. Indemnification Indemnification and limitation of liability 158. Every Indemnified Person shall, in the absence of wilful neglect or default, be indemnified and held harmless out of the assets of the Company against all liabilities, loss, damage, cost or expense (including but not limited to liabilities under contract, tort and statute or any applicable foreign law or regulation and all reasonable legal and other costs and expenses on a full Indemnification basis properly payable) incurred or suffered by him by or by reason of any act done, conceived in or omitted in the conduct of the Company’s business or in the discharge of his duties and the Indemnification contained in this Article shall extTermination to any Indemnified Person acting in any office or trust in the reasonable belief that he has been appointed or elected to such office or trust notwithstanding any defect in such appointment or election. 36 159. No Indemnified Person shall be liable to the Company for acts, defaults or omissions of any other Indemnified Person. Indemnification and reimbursement 160. Every Indemnified Person shall be indemnified out of the funds of the Company against all liabilities incurred by him by or by reason of any act done, conceived in or omitted in the conduct of the Company’s business or in the discharge of his duties in defTerminationing any proceedings, whether civil or criminal, in which judgment is given in his favour, or in which he is acquitted, or in connection with any application in which relief from liability is granted to him by the court. 161. To the extent that any Indemnified Person is entitled to claim an Indemnification pursuant to these Articles in respect of amounts paid or discharged by him, the relative Indemnification shall take effect as an obligation of the Company to reimburse the person making such payment or effecting such discharge. Wilful neglect or default 162. Each Member and the Company agree to waive any claim or right of action he or it may at any time have, whether individually or by or in the right of the Company, against any Indemnified Person on account of any act or omission of such Indemnified Person in the performance of his duties for the Company; provided however, that such waiver shall not apply to any claims or rights of action arising out of the wilful neglect or default of such Indemnified Person or to recover any gain, personal profit or advantage to which such Indemnified Person is not legally entitled. Advance of legal fees 163. Expenses incurred in defTerminationing any civil or criminal action or proceeding for which indemnification is required pursuant to these Articles shall be paid by the Company in advance of the final disposition of such action or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnified Person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that the Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified pursuant to these Articles. Each Member of the Company shall be deemed to have acknowledged and agreed that the advances of funds may be made by the Company as aforesaid, and when made by the Company under this Article are made to meet expTerminationitures incurred for the purpose of enabling such Indemnified Person to properly perform his or her duties to the Company. 37 CONTINUATION 164. The Company shall have the power, subject to the provisions of the Law and with the approval of a Special Resolution, to continue as a body incorporated under the laws of any jurisdiction outside of the Cayman Islands and to be de-registered in the Cayman Islands. AMTerminationMENT OF MEMORANDUM AND ARTICLES Subject to the provisions of the Law, the Company may from time to time by Special Resolution alter or amTermination the Memorandum or these Articles in whole or in part provided that no such amTerminationment shall affect the special rights attaching to any class of Shares without the consent or sanction provided for in these Articles.

The Directors may fix in advance a date as the record date to determine the Members entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of the Members and, for the purpose of determining the Members entitled to receive payment of any dividTermination, the Directors may, at or within 90 days prior to the date of the declaration of such dividTermination, fix a subsequent date as the record date for such determination. No fixed record date 11. If no such record date is fixed, the record date shall be the date on which notice of the meeting is sent or the date on which the resolution of the Directors declaring such dividTermination is adopted, as the case may be. A determination of Members entitled to vote at any meeting of Members in accordance with this Article, shall apply to any adjournment thereof. SHARE CERTIFICATES Issue of Share Certificates 12. Every Member shall be entitled, without payment, to a certificate of the Company specifying the Share or Shares held by him and the amount paid up thereon. 13. Notwithstanding the provisions of these Articles, the Directors may resolve not to issue share certificates to Members of the Company. Certificates for jointly-held Shares 14. The Company shall not be bound to issue more than one certificate for Shares held jointly by more than one person, and delivery of a certificate to one joint holder shall be sufficient delivery to all. Replacement Share Certificates 15. If a share certificate is defaced, lost or destroyed, it may be replaced on payment of such fee (if any) and on such terms (if any) as to evidence and Indemnification, and on the payment of expenses of the Company in investigating such evidence and preparing such Indemnification as the Directors shall think fit and, in case of defacement, on delivery of the old certificate to the Company for cancellation. 6 Assignment OF SHARES Instrument of Assignment 16. The instrument of Assignment of any Share shall be executed by or on behalf of the Assignmentor (and, if the Directors so determine, the Assignmentee). The Assignmentor shall be deemed to remain the holder of the Share until the name of the Assignmentee is entered in the Register of Members in respect of such Share. All instruments of Assignment, once registered, may be retained by the Company. 17. Subject to any applicable restrictions contained in these Articles, Shares shall be Assignmentred in any usual or common form approved by the Directors. Refusal to register Assignments 18. The Directors may, in their absolute discretion and without assigning any reason therefore, decline to register any Assignment of any Share. The Directors may require reasonable evidence to show the right of the Assignmentor to make the Assignment. 19. If the Directors decline to register a Assignment of Shares they shall sTermination notice of the refusal to the Assignmentee within one month after the date on which the Assignment was lodged with the Company. 20. The Directors may also suspTermination the registration of the Assignments at such times and for such periods as the Directors may from time to time determine. TRANSMISSION OF SHARES Transmission of Shares 21. If a Member dies, the survivor or survivors (where he was a joint holder), and the legal personal representative (where he was sole holder), shall be the only person recognised by the Company as having any title to the Share. The estate of a deceased Member is not thereby released from any liability in respect of any Share held by him, whether solely or jointly. For the purpose of this Article, legal personal representative means the person to whom probate or letters of administration has or have been granted in the Cayman Islands or, if there is no such person, such other person as the Directors may in their absolute discretion determine to be the person recognised by the Company for the purpose of this Article. Election by persons entitled on transmission 22. Any person becoming entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a Member or otherwise by operation of Governing Law may elect, upon such evidence being produced as may be required by the Directors as to his entitlement, either be registered himself as a Member in respect of the Share or, instead of being registered himself, to make such Assignment of the Share as the deceased or bankrupt Member could have made. 7 Manner of election 23. If the person so becoming entitled elects to be registered himself, he shall deliver or sTermination to the Company a notice in writing signed by him stating that he so elects. If he shall elect to Assignment the Shares, he shall signify his election by signing an instrument of Assignment of such Shares in favour of his Assignmentee. All the limitations, restrictions and provisions of these Articles relating to the right to Assignment and the registration of Assignments of Shares shall be applicable to any such notice or instrument of Assignment as aforesaid as if the death of the Member or other event giving rise to the transmission had not occurred and the notice or instrument of Assignment was an instrument of Assignment signed by such Member. Rights of persons entitled on transmission 24. A person becoming entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of the Member (or otherwise by operation of Governing Law), upon such evidence being produced as may be required by the Directors as to his entitlement, shall be entitled to the same dividTerminations and other monies payable in respect of the Share as he would be entitled if he were the holder of such Share. However, he shall not be entitled, until he becomes registered as the holder of such Share, to receive notices of or to attTermination or vote at general meetings of the Company or (except as aforesaid) to exercise any other rights or privileges of a Member. The Directors may at any time give notice requiring such person to elect either to be registered himself or to Assignment the Share and, if the notice is not complied with within sixty days, the Directors may thereafter withhold payment of all dividTerminations and other monies payable in respect of the Shares until the requirements of the notice have been complied with. REDEMPTION AND PURCHASE OF SHARES 25. Subject to the provisions of the Law and the Memorandum, the Company may: 25.1 purchase its own Shares (including any redeemable Shares) in such manner and on such terms as the Directors may agree with the relevant Member unless following such purchase there would no longer be any issued Shares and may make payment for such purchase or for any redemption of Shares in any manner authorised by the Law, including out of capital; and 25.2 reduce its share capital and any capital redemption reserve fund in any manner whatsoever. 8 VARIATION OF SHARE RIGHTS Variation of class rights 26. If at any time the share capital is divided into different classes of Shares, all or any of the special rights attached to any class of Shares (unless otherwise provided by the terms of issue of the Shares of that class) may be varied or abrogated with the consent in writing of the holders of not less than two thirds of the issued Shares of that class or with the sanction of a resolution passed by the holders of not less than two thirds of the issued Shares of that class as may be present in person or by proxy at a separate general meeting of the holders of the Shares of that class. To any such separate general meeting, all of the provisions of these Articles relating to general meetings shall mutatis mutandis apply, but so that the necessary quorum shall be any one or more persons holding or representing by proxy not less than one third of the issued Shares of the class and that any holder of Shares of the relevant class present in person or by proxy may demand a poll. Treatment of classes 27. For the purpose of a separate class meeting, the Directors may treat two or more of all classes of Shares as forming one class if they consider that such class of Shares would be affected in the same way by the proposals under consideration. Effect of Share issue on class rights 28. The rights conferred upon the holders of any Shares shall not, unless otherwise expressly provided in the rights attaching to such Shares, be deemed to be altered by the creation or issue of further Shares ranking pari passu therewith. NON-RECOGNITION OF TRUSTS 29. Except as required by the Law or these Articles, or under an order of a court of competent jurisdiction, the Company shall not be bound by or compelled to recognise in any way, even when notice thereof is given to it, any equitable, contingent, future or partial interest in any Share, or any other rights in respect of any Share other than an absolute right to the entirety thereof in the registered holder. 9 LIEN Lien generally 30. The Company shall have a first and paramount lien on every Share (not being a fully paid Share) for all moneys (whether presently payable or not) called or payable at a date fixed by or in accordance with the terms of issue of such Share in respect of that Share, and the Company shall also have a first and paramount lien on every Share (other than a fully paid up Share) standing registered in the name of a Member, whether singly or jointly with any other person for all debts and liabilities of a Member or his estate to the Company, whether the same shall have been incurred before or after notice to the Company of any interest of any person other than such Member, and whether the time for the payment or discharge of the same shall have actually arrived or not, and notwithstanding that the same are joint debts or liabilities of such Member or his estate and any other person, whether a Member or not. The Directors may at any time, either generally or in any particular case, waive any lien that has arisen or declare any Share to be wholly or in part exempt from the provisions of this Article. The Company's lien, if any, on a Share shall extTermination to all dividTerminations payable thereon. Enforcement 31. The Company may sell, in such manner as the Directors think fit, any Share on which the Company has a lien, provided a sum in respect of which the lien exists is presently payable, and is not paid within fourteen days after a notice in writing has been given to the registered holder  for the time being of the Share, demanding payment of the sum presently payable and giving notice of the intention to sell in default of such payment. Completion of sale 32. For giving effect to any such sale, the Directors may authorise any person to Assignment the Share sold to the purchaser thereof. The purchaser shall be registered as the holder of the Share comprised in any such Assignment and he shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money, nor shall his title to the Share be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings relating to the sale. Application of proceeds 33. The net proceeds of such sale shall be applied in payment or discharge of the debt or liability in respect of which the lien exists and as is presently payable, and any balance shall (subject to a like lien for debts or liabilities not presently payable as existed upon the Shares prior to the sale) be paid to the person who was the registered holder of the Share immediately before such sale. CALLS ON SHARES Calls on Shares generally 34. The Directors may from time to time make calls upon the Members in respect of any moneys unpaid on their Shares (whether in respect of the par value of the Shares or premium or otherwise and not, by the terms of issue thereof, made payable at a future date fixed by or in accordance with such terms of issue); and each Member shall (subject to the Company serving upon him at least 14 days’ notice specifying the time or times and place of payment) pay to the Company at the time or times and place so specified the amount called on his Shares. A call may be revoked or postponed by the Directors wholly or in part as the Directors may determine. A call shall be deemed to have been made at the time when the resolution of the Directors authorising the call was passed. 10 Payment 35. Payment of a call may be made by instalments on the direction of the Directors. 36. If a sum called in respect of a Share is not paid before or on the day appointed for payment thereof, the person from whom the sum is due shall pay interest on the sum from the day payment is due to the time of the actual payment at such rate as the Directors may determine, but the Directors may waive payment of such interest wholly or in part. 37. Any sum payable in respect of a Share on issue or allotment or at any fixed date, whether in respect of the par value of the Share or premium or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a call and if it is not paid all the relevant provisions as to payment of interest, forfeiture or otherwise of these Articles shall apply as if such sum had become due and payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified. 38. The Directors may issue Shares with different terms as to the amount and times of payment of calls. Liability of joint holders 39. The joint holders of a Share shall be jointly and severally liable to pay calls in respect thereof. Interest 40. The Directors may, if they think fit, receive from any Member willing to advance the same, all or any part of the moneys uncalled and unpaid upon any Shares held by him; and may (until the amount would otherwise become payable) pay interest at such rate (not exceeding six per cent without the sanction of the Company in general meeting) as may be agreed upon between the Member paying the sum in advance and the Directors. FORFEITURE OF SHARES Notice 41. If a Member fails to pay any call or instalment of a call by the date it becomes due and payable, the Directors may, at any time thereafter while such call or instalment remains unpaid, give notice to the Member requiring payment of the unpaid portion of the call or instalment, together with any accrued interest and expenses incurred by the Company by reason of such non-payment. 11 42. The notice shall specify where and by what date (not being less than the Termination of 14 days’ from the date of the notice) payment is to be made and shall state that if it is not complied with the Shares in respect of which the call was made will be liable to be forfeited. The Directors may accept the surrTerminationer of any Share liable to be forfeited hereunder and, in such case, references to these Articles to forfeiture shall include surrTerminationer. Forfeiture for non-compliance 43. If such notice is not complied with, any Share in respect of which the notice was given may thereafter, before the payment of all calls or instalments and interest due in respect thereof has been made, be forfeited by a resolution of the Directors. Such forfeiture shall include all dividTerminations declared, other distributions or other monies payable in respect of the forfeited Shares and not paid before the forfeiture. Forfeited Shares 44. A forfeited Share may be sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed of upon such terms and in such manner as the Directors shall think fit, and at any time before a sale, re-allotment or disposition, the forfeiture may be cancelled on such terms as the Directors think fit. Continued liability for forfeited Member 45. A person whose Shares have been forfeited shall cease to be a Member in respect of the forfeited Shares, but shall remain liable to pay to the Company all moneys which at the date of forfeiture were presently payable by him in respect of the Shares together with interest at such rate as the Directors may determine from the date of forfeiture until payment, but his liability shall cease if and when the Company receives payment in full of all amounts due in respect of the Shares. The Company may enforce payment without being under any obligation to make any allowance for the value of the Shares forfeited. Evidence of forfeiture 46. An affidavit in writing by a Director or Secretary of the Company that a Share has been duly forfeited on a specified date, shall be conclusive evidence of the facts stated in it as against all persons claiming to be entitled to the Share. The Company may receive the consideration, if any, given for the Share on any sale, re-allotment or disposition thereof and may authorise some person to execute a Assignment of the Share in favour of the person to whom the Share is sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed of, and he shall thereupon be registered as the holder of the Share, and shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money (if any) nor shall his title to the Share be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings in reference to the forfeiture, sale, re-allotment or disposition of the Share. 12 47. The provisions of these Articles as to forfeiture shall apply in the case of non-payment of any sum which, by the terms of issue of a Share, becomes payable at a fixed time, whether on account of the par value of the Share, or by way of premium or otherwise, as if the same had been made payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified to the Member. INCREASE OF CAPITAL 48. The Company may from time to time by Ordinary Resolution increase its share capital by such sum, to be divided into new Shares of such par value, and with such rights, priorities and privileges attached thereto as the resolution shall prescribe. 49. Subject to any directions given by the Company in a general meeting, all new Shares shall be at the disposal of the Directors in accordance with these Articles. 50. The new Shares shall be subject to the same provisions of these Articles with reference to the payment of calls, lien, forfeiture, Assignment, transmission and otherwise, as the Shares in the original share capital. ALTERATION OF CAPITAL 51. The Company may from time to time by Ordinary Resolution: 51.1 consolidate and divide all or any of its share capital into Shares of larger par value than its existing Shares; 51.2 sub divide its existing Shares, or any of them, into Shares of smaller par value than is fixed by the Memorandum, subject nevertheless to the provisions of section 13 of the Law; 51.3 cancel any Shares which, at the date of the passing of the resolution, have not been taken or agreed to be taken by any person; and 51.4 convert all or any paid up Shares into stock, and reconvert all or any stock into paid up Shares of any denomination. 52. The Company may from time to time by Special Resolution: 52.1 divide its Shares into several classes and attach to such classes any preferential, deferred, or special rights or restrictions in accordance with these Articles; 52.2 change the currency denomination of its share capital; 13 52.3 reduce its share capital and any capital redemption reserve fund in any manner whatsoever; and 52.4 merge or consolidate with any one or more constituent companies (as defined in the Law). GENERAL MEETINGS Convening a meeting 53. The Directors may, whenever they think fit, convene an extraordinary general meeting. If at any time there are not sufficient Directors capable of acting to form a quorum, any Director, or any one or more Members holding in the aggregate not less than one third of the total issued share capital of the Company entitled to vote, may convene an extraordinary general meeting in the same manner as nearly as possible as that in which meetings may be convened by the Directors. Members’ requisition 54. The Directors shall, upon the requisition in writing of one or more Members holding in the aggregate not less than one tenth of such paid up capital of the Company as at the date of the requisition carries the right of voting at general meetings, convene an extraordinary general meeting. Any such requisition shall express the object of the meeting proposed to be called, and must be signed by the requisitionists and deposited at the Registered Office, and may consist of several documents in like form, each signed by one or more requisitionists. 55. If there are no Directors as at the date of the deposit of the Members’ requisition or if the Directors do not convene a general meeting within 21 days from the date of the deposit, the requisitionists or any or any of them or any other Member or Members holding in the aggregate not less than one tenth of such paid up capital of the Company as at the date of the requisition, may convene an extraordinary general meeting. A general meeting convened by requisitionists shall be convened in the same manner as nearly as possible as that in which general meetings are to be convened by the Directors. NOTICE OF GENERAL MEETINGS Length and form of notice 56. At least five clear days’ notice shall be given of any general meeting. Every notice shall specify the place, the day and the time of meeting and, in the case of special business, the general nature of the business to be conducted at the general meeting, and shall be given in the manner provided in these Articles or in such other manner (if any) as may be prescribed by the Company, to such persons as are entitled to receive such notices from the Company. A general meeting may be convened by such shorter notice, or without notice, by a majority in number of the Members having the right to attTermination and vote at the meeting, being a majority together holding not less than ninety-five percent in nominal value of the Shares giving that right. 14 Omission or non-receipt 57. The accidental omission to give notice of a meeting to, or the non-receipt of a notice of a meeting by, any Member entitled to receive notice shall not invalidate the proceedings at any meeting. PROCEEDINGS AT GENERAL MEETINGS 58. All business shall be deemed special that is transacted at an extraordinary general meeting. Quorum 59. No business shall be transacted at any general meeting unless a quorum of Members is present at the time that the meeting proceeds to business, but the absence of a quorum shall not preclude the appointment, choice or election of a chairman, which shall not be treated as part of the business of the Meeting. Save as herein otherwise provided, one or more Members holding in the aggregate not less than one third of the total issued share capital of the Company present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall be a quorum. Adjournment for lack of quorum 60. If within five minutes (or such longer time as the chairman of the meeting may determine to wait) after the time appointed for the meeting, a quorum is not present, the meeting, if convened upon the requisition of Members, shall be dissolved. In any other case, it shall stand adjourned to the same day in the next week, at the same time and place, and if at the adjourned meeting a quorum is not present within half an hour from the time appointed for the meeting, the Members present shall be a quorum. Meeting by telephone or other facilities 61. A meeting of the Members may be held by telephone, electronic or other communication facilities (including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, by telephone or video conferencing) by which all persons participating in the meeting can communicate with each other simultaneously and instantaneously, and participation in such a general meeting shall constitute presence in person at such meeting. 62. Any Director shall be entitled to attTermination and speak at any general meeting of the Company. 15 Appointment of chairman 63. The chairman (if any) of the Board of Directors shall preside as chairman at every general meeting of the Company. If there is no such chairman, or if at any meeting he is not present within five minutes after the time appointed for holding the meeting or is unwilling to act as chairman, the Directors present shall choose one of their number to act or, if only one Director is present, he shall preside as chairman if willing to act. If no Director is present, or if each of the Directors present declines to take the chair, the Members present and entitled to vote shall elect one of their number to be chairman. Adjournment of meeting 64. The chairman may, with the consent of a meeting at which a quorum is present (and shall if so directed by the meeting) adjourn the meeting from time to time and from place to place, but no business shall be transacted at any adjourned meeting other than the business left unfinished at the meeting from which the adjournment took place. When a meeting is adjourned for ten days or more, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given as in the case of an original meeting. Save as aforesaid, it shall not be necessary to give any notice of an adjournment or of the business to be transacted at an adjourned meeting. VOTING Ordinary Resolution Save where a Special Resolution or other greater majority is required by the Law or these Articles, any question proposed for consideration at any general meeting shall be decided by an Ordinary Resolution. Voting on a show of hands 65. At any general meeting, a resolution put to the vote of the meeting shall be decided on a show of hands, unless before or on the declaration of the result of the show of hands, or on the withdrawal of any other demand for a poll. Demand for poll 66. A poll is demanded by: 66.1 the chairman of the meeting; or 66.2 at least three Members present in person or by proxy; or 66.3 any Member or Members present in person or by proxy and holding collectively not less than one tenth of the total voting rights of all the Members having the right to vote at such meeting; or 16 66.4 a Member or Members present in person or by proxy holding Shares conferring the right to vote at such meeting, being Shares on which an aggregate sum has been paid up equal to not less than one tenth of the total sum paid up on all such Shares conferring such right. 67. Unless a poll is duly demanded and the demand is not withdrawn, a declaration by the chairman that a resolution has, on a show of hands, been carried or carried unanimously, or by a particular majority, or lost and an entry to that effect in the minutes of the proceedings of the Company shall be conclusive evidence of that fact, without proof of the number or proportion of the votes recorded in favour of, or against, that resolution. The demand for a poll may be withdrawn by the person or any persons making it at any time prior to the declaration of the result of the poll. 68. If a poll is duly demanded, it shall be taken in such manner as the chairman directs, and the result of the poll shall be deemed to be the resolution of the meeting at which the poll was demanded. 69. In the case of an equality of votes at a general meeting, whether on a show of hands or on a poll, the chairman of the meeting at which the show of hands takes place or at which the poll is demanded, shall not be entitled to a second or casting vote and the resolution shall fail. 70. A poll demanded on the election of a chairman or on a question of adjournment shall be taken forthwith.

A committee may meet and adjourn as it thinks proper. Questions arising at any meeting shall be determined by a majority of votes of the members present and in case of an equality of votes the chairman shall not have a second or casting vote and the motion shall be deemed to have been lost. Officers 127. The Directors may appoint a Secretary and such other officers as they may from time to time consider necessary upon such terms as to duration of office, remuneration and otherwise as they may think fit. Such Secretary or other officers need not be Directors and in the case of the other officers may be ascribed such titles as the Directors may decide and the Directors may revoke or terminate any such election or appointment. Any such revocation or termination shall be without prejudice to any claim for any damages that such officer may have against the Company or the Company may have against such officer for any breach of any contract of service between him and the Company which may be involved in such revocation or termination.

DIVIDTerminationS Payment of DividTerminations 134. The Directors may from time to time declare dividTerminations to be paid to the Members according to their rights and interests, including such interim dividTerminations as appear to the Directors to be justified by the position of the Company. The Directors may also pay any fixed cash dividTermination which is payable on any Shares of the Company half yearly or on such other dates, whenever the position of the Company, in the opinion of the Directors, justifies such payment. 135. No dividTermination shall be paid otherwise than out of profits or out of monies otherwise available for dividTermination in accordance with the Law. Calculation of DividTerminations 136. Subject to the rights of Members, if any, entitled to Shares with special rights as to dividTerminations, all dividTerminations shall be declared and paid according to the amount paid up on the Shares in respect of which the dividTermination is paid and any dividTermination on any class of Shares not fully paid shall be declared and paid according to the amounts paid on the Shares of that class, but if and so long as nothing is paid up on any of the Shares in the Company, dividTerminations may be declared and paid according to the number of Shares. No amount paid on a Share in advance of calls shall, while carrying interest, be treated for the purposes of this Article as paid on the Share. DividTerminations may be apportioned and paid pro rata according to the amounts paid-up on the Shares during any portion or portions of the period in respect of which the dividTermination is paid. 31 Deductions 137. The Directors may deduct from any dividTermination, distribution or other monies payable to a Member by the Company on or in respect of any Shares all sums of money (if any) presently payable by him to the Company on account of calls or otherwise in respect of Shares of the Company. Joint Holders 138. If several persons are registered as joint holders of any Share, any of them may give effectual receipts for any dividTermination or other money payable on or in respect of the Share. Payment method 139. Any dividTermination may be paid by cheque or warrant sent through the post to the address of the Member or person entitled thereto in the Register of Members or, in the case of joint holders addressed to the holder whose name stands first in the Register of Members in respect of the Shares at his registered address as appearing on the Register of Members or to such person and such address as the Member or person entitled or such joint holders as the case may be may direct in writing. Every such cheque or warrant shall, unless the holder or joint holders may in writing direct, be made payable to the order of the person to whom it is sent or to the order of the holder or, in the case of joint holders, to the order of the holder whose name stands first in the Register of Members in respect of such Shares, and shall be sent at his or their risk and payment of the cheque or warrant by the bank on which it is drawn shall constitute a good discharge to the Company. Any one of two or more joint holders may give effectual receipts for any dividTerminations, distributions or other monies payable or property distributable in respect of the Shares held by such joint holders. Satisfaction by distribution of specific assets 140. The Directors may declare that any dividTermination or distribution is paid wholly or partly by the distribution of specific assets and, in particular, of paid up shares, debentures or debenture stock of any other company or in any one or more of such ways, and where any difficulty arises in regard to such dividTermination or distribution, the Directors may settle the same as they think expedient, and in particular may issue fractional Shares or ignore fractions altogether and may fix the value for dividTermination or distribution of such specific assets or any part thereof and may determine that cash payments shall be made to any Members upon the basis of the value so fixed in order to secure equality of distribution, and may vest any such specific assets in trustees as may seem expedient to the Directors. 32 No interest 141. No dividTermination or other distribution or other monies payable by the Company on or in respect of any Share shall bear interest against the Company. Unclaimed dividTerminations 142. All unclaimed dividTerminations or distributions may be invested or otherwise made use of by the Directors for the benefit of the Company until claimed. Any dividTermination or distribution unclaimed by a Member six years after the dividTermination or distribution payment date shall be forfeited and revert to the Company. RESERVES 143. The Directors may, before declaring any dividTermination or distribution, set aside such sums as they think proper as a reserve or reserves which shall, at the discretion of the Directors, be applicable for meeting contingencies, or for equalising dividTerminations, or for any other purpose of the Company, and pTerminationing such application may, in their discretion, be employed in the business of the Company or be invested in such manner as the Directors may from time to time think fit. The Directors may also without placing the same to reserve carry forward any sums which they think it prudent not to distribute. CAPITALISATION OF PROFITS Capitalisation 144. The Directors may capitalise any sum standing to the credit of any of the Company’s reserve accounts which are available for distribution (including its Share Premium Account and capital redemption reserve fund, subject to the Law) or any sum standing to the credit of the profit and loss account or otherwise available for distribution and to appropriate such sums to Members in the proportions in which such sum would have been divisible amongst them had the same been a distribution of profits by way of dividTermination and to apply such sum on their behalf in paying up in full unissued Shares for allotment and distribution credited as fully paid-up to and amongst them in the proportion aforesaid. Authorisation 145. Where any difficulty arises in regard to any distribution under the last preceding Article, the Directors may settle the same as they think expedient and, in particular, may authorise any person to sell and Assignment any fractions or may resolve that the distribution should be as nearly as may be practicable in the correct proportion but not exactly so or may ignore fractions altogether, and may determine that cash payments should be made to any Members in order to adjust the rights of all parties, as may seem expedient to the Directors. The Directors may appoint any person to sign on behalf of the persons entitled to participate in the distribution any contract necessary or desirable for giving effect thereto and such appointment shall be effective and binding upon the Members. 33 SHARE PREMIUM ACCOUNT 146. The Directors shall in accordance with the Law establish a Share Premium Account and shall carry to the credit of such account from time to time a sum equal to the amount or value of the premium paid on the issue of any Share. 147. There shall be debited to any Share Premium Account on the redemption or purchase of a Share the difference between the nominal value of such Share and the redemption or purchase price provided always that at the discretion of the Directors such sum may be paid out of the profits of the Company or, if permitted by the Law, out of capital. ACCOUNTING RECORDS Books of account 148.

The liquidator may, with the like sanction, vest the whole or any part of such assets in trustees upon such trusts for the benefit of the contributories as the liquidator, with the like sanction, shall think fit, but so that no Member shall be compelled to accept any asset upon which there is any liability. Distribution of assets 157.

And if in a winding up the assets available for distribution amongst the Members shall be more than sufficient to repay the whole of the capital paid up at the commencement of the winding up, the excess shall be distributed amongst the Members in proportion to the capital paid up at the commencement of the winding up on the Shares held by them respectively. This Article is to be without prejudice to the rights of the holders of Shares issued upon special terms and conditions. Indemnification Indemnification and limitation of liability 158.

To the extent that any Indemnified Person is entitled to claim an Indemnification pursuant to these Articles in respect of amounts paid or discharged by him, the relative Indemnification shall take effect as an obligation of the Company to reimburse the person making such payment or effecting such discharge.

Each Member and the Company agree to waive any claim or right of action he or it may at any time have, whether individually or by or in the right of the Company, against any Indemnified Person on account of any act or omission of such Indemnified Person in the performance of his duties for the Company; provided however, that such waiver shall not apply to any claims or rights of action arising out of the wilful neglect or default of such Indemnified Person or to recover any gain, personal profit or advantage to which such Indemnified Person is not legally entitled. Advance of legal fees 163. Expenses incurred in defTerminationing any civil or criminal action or proceeding for which indemnification is required pursuant to these Articles shall be paid by the Company in advance of the final disposition of such action or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnified Person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that the Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified pursuant to these Articles. Each Member of the Company shall be deemed to have acknowledged and agreed that the advances of funds may be made by the Company as aforesaid, and when made by the Company under this Article are made to meet expTerminationitures incurred for the purpose of enabling such Indemnified Person to properly perform his or her duties to the Company. 37 CONTINUATION 164.
