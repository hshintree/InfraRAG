    "# InfraRAG Environment Setup Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide provides step-by-step instructions to set up the complete development environment for InfraRAG, a legal document RAG system for drafting purchase agreements.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- Conda installed on your system\n",
    "- Git\n",
    "- Docker (for supporting services)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environment Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Clone the Repository\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git clone <repository-url>\n",
    "cd InfraRAG\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Create Conda Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Create the conda environment using the provided environment file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda env create -f environment-cpu.yml\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: If you have CUDA-capable GPU, you can use `environment-cuda.yml` instead for GPU acceleration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Activate the Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda activate infra-rag\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Install Additional Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "Some packages need to be installed separately via pip due to conda compatibility issues:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Core retrieval and NLP packages\n",
    "pip install qdrant-client opensearch-py sentence-transformers spacy pymupdf\n",
    "\n",
    "# Document processing packages\n",
    "pip install pdfplumber unstructured python-docx rank-bm25 rapidfuzz\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Verify Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "Test that all key packages are working:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -c \"\n",
    "import qdrant_client\n",
    "import opensearchpy\n",
    "import sentence_transformers\n",
    "import spacy\n",
    "import fitz  # PyMuPDF\n",
    "import pdfplumber\n",
    "import unstructured\n",
    "from docx import Document\n",
    "import rank_bm25\n",
    "import rapidfuzz\n",
    "import langchain\n",
    "import llama_index\n",
    "print('âœ… All key packages imported successfully!')\n",
    "\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Set Up Supporting Services (Optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "Start the vector database and search services using Docker:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Start Qdrant (vector database) and OpenSearch (BM25 search)\n",
    "docker-compose -f docker-compose.rag.yml up -d\n",
    "\n",
    "# Verify services are running\n",
    "docker ps\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will start:\n",
    "- **Qdrant** on port 6333 (vector database)\n",
    "- **OpenSearch** on port 9200 (BM25 search engine)\n",
    "- **OpenSearch Dashboards** on port 5601 (web UI)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Environment Activation for Future Sessions\n",
    "\n",
    "For future development sessions, simply activate the environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda activate infra-rag\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To update dependencies when new packages are added:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda env update -f environment-cpu.yml\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Package Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The environment includes packages for:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Web Framework\n",
    "- **FastAPI**: Modern web framework for APIs\n",
    "- **Uvicorn**: ASGI server\n",
    "- **Pydantic**: Data validation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Retrieval Stack\n",
    "- **Qdrant Client**: Vector database client\n",
    "- **OpenSearch**: BM25 search engine\n",
    "- **Rank-BM25**: Local BM25 implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "### NLP & Embeddings\n",

    "\n",
    "## Troubleshooting\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Issues\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Conda environment creation fails**: \n",
    "   - Try using `environment-cpu.yml` instead of `environment-cuda.yml`\n",
    "   - Update conda: `conda update conda`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Import errors after installation**:\n",
    "   - Ensure you've activated the environment: `conda activate infra-rag`\n",
    "   - Install missing packages individually with pip\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Docker services won't start**:\n",
    "   - Check if ports 6333, 9200, 5601 are available\n",
    "   - Ensure Docker daemon is running\n",
    "\n",
    "### Package Compatibility Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- Some packages (like `opentelemetry-instrumentation-fastapi`) had version constraints with Python 3.11\n",
    "- We use compatible versions in the environment files to avoid conflicts\n",
    "- Additional packages are installed via pip after conda environment creation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Architecture Components\n",
    "\n",
    "This environment supports the full InfraRAG pipeline:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Ingestion**: PDF/XML parsing with PyMuPDF, pdfplumber, lxml\n",
    "2. **Indexing**: Hybrid search with Qdrant (vectors) + OpenSearch (BM25)\n",
    "3. **Retrieval**: Multi-stage retrieval with reranking\n",
    "4. **Planning**: Clause selection and document structure planning\n",
    "5. **Drafting**: RAG-based content generation\n",
    "6. **Validation**: Rule-based checks and schema validation\n",
    "7. **Assembly**: DOCX generation with citations\n",
    "8. **Review**: Web UI for human-in-the-loop editing\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "After environment setup:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Configure API keys in `.env` file (OpenAI, etc.)\n",
    "2. Start the supporting services with Docker\n",
    "3. Run the ingestion pipeline to process your legal documents\n",
    "4. Test the retrieval and generation components\n",
    "5. Launch the web interface for document drafting\n",
    "\n",
